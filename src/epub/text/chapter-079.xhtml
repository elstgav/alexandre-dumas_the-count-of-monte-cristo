      <h2>Chapter 79. The Lemonade</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>orrel was, in
        fact, very happy. M. Noirtier had just sent for him, and he was in such
        haste to know the reason of his doing so that he had not stopped to take a
        cab, placing infinitely more dependence on his own two legs than on the
        four legs of a cab-horse. He had therefore set off at a furious rate from
        the Rue Meslay, and was hastening with rapid strides in the direction of
        the Faubourg Saint-Honor√©.
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel advanced with a firm, manly tread, and poor Barrois followed him as
        he best might. Morrel was only thirty-one, Barrois was sixty years of age;
        Morrel was deeply in love, and Barrois was dying with heat and exertion.
        These two men, thus opposed in age and interests, resembled two parts of a
        triangle, presenting the extremes of separation, yet nevertheless
        possessing their point of union. This point of union was Noirtier, and it
        was he who had just sent for Morrel, with the request that the latter
        would lose no time in coming to him&mdash;a command which Morrel obeyed to
        the letter, to the great discomfiture of Barrois. On arriving at the
        house, Morrel was not even out of breath, for love lends wings to our
        desires; but Barrois, who had long forgotten what it was to love, was
        sorely fatigued by the expedition he had been constrained to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        The old servant introduced Morrel by a private entrance, closed the door
        of the study, and soon the rustling of a dress announced the arrival of
        Valentine. She looked marvellously beautiful in her deep mourning dress,
        and Morrel experienced such intense delight in gazing upon her that he
        felt as if he could almost have dispensed with the conversation of her
        grandfather.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the easy-chair of the old man was heard rolling along the floor, and he soon
        made his appearance in the room. Noirtier acknowledged by a look of extreme
        kindness and benevolence the thanks which Morrel lavished on him for his timely
        intervention on behalf of Valentine and himself&mdash;an intervention which had
        saved them from despair. Morrel then cast on the invalid an interrogative look as
        to the new favor which he designed to bestow on him. Valentine was sitting at a
        little distance from them, timidly awaiting the moment when she should be obliged
        to speak. Noirtier fixed his eyes on her.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Am I to say what you told me?&rdquo; asked Valentine. Noirtier made a
        sign that she was to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Monsieur Morrel,&rdquo; said Valentine to the young man, who was
        regarding her with the most intense interest, &ldquo;my grandfather, M.
        Noirtier, had a thousand things to say, which he told me three days ago;
        and now, he has sent for you, that I may repeat them to you. I will repeat
        them, then; and since he has chosen me as his interpreter, I will be
        faithful to the trust, and will not alter a word of his intentions.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I am listening with the greatest impatience,&rdquo; replied the
        young man; &ldquo;speak, I beg of you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine cast down her eyes; this was a good omen for Morrel, for he knew that
        nothing but happiness could have the power of thus overcoming Valentine.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My grandfather intends leaving this house,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and
        Barrois is looking out for suitable apartments for him in another.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But you, Mademoiselle de Villefort,&mdash;you, who are necessary to
        M. Noirtier&rsquo;s happiness&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I?&rdquo; interrupted Valentine; &ldquo;I shall not leave my
        grandfather,&mdash;that is an understood thing between us. My apartment
        will be close to his. Now, M. de Villefort must either give his consent to
        this plan or his refusal; in the first case, I shall leave directly, and
        in the second, I shall wait till I am of age, which will be in about ten
        months. Then I shall be free, I shall have an independent fortune, and&rdquo;&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what?&rdquo; demanded Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And with my grandfather&rsquo;s consent I shall fulfil the promise
        which I have made you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine pronounced these last few words in such a low tone, that nothing but
        Morrel&rsquo;s intense interest in what she was saying could have enabled him to
        hear them.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have I not explained your wishes, grandpapa?&rdquo; said Valentine,
        addressing Noirtier.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; looked the old man.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Once under my grandfather&rsquo;s roof, M. Morrel can visit me in the
        presence of my good and worthy protector, if we still feel that the union we
        contemplated will be likely to insure our future comfort and happiness; in that
        case I shall expect M. Morrel to come and claim me at my own hands. But, alas, I
        have heard it said that hearts inflamed by obstacles to their desire grew
        cold in time of security; I trust we shall never find it so in our
        experience!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Morrel, almost tempted to throw himself on his
        knees before Noirtier and Valentine, and to adore them as two superior
        beings, &ldquo;what have I ever done in my life to merit such unbounded
        happiness?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Until that time,&rdquo; continued the young girl in a calm and
        self-possessed tone of voice, &ldquo;we will conform to circumstances, and
        be guided by the wishes of our friends, so long as those wishes do not
        tend finally to separate us; in a word, and I repeat it, because it
        expresses all I wish to convey,&mdash;we will wait.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And I swear to make all the sacrifices which this word imposes,
        sir,&rdquo; said Morrel, &ldquo;not only with resignation, but with
        cheerfulness.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Therefore,&rdquo; continued Valentine, looking playfully at
        Maximilian, &ldquo;no more inconsiderate actions&mdash;no more rash
        projects; for you surely would not wish to compromise one who from this
        day regards herself as destined, honorably and happily, to bear your name?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel looked obedience to her commands. Noirtier regarded the lovers with
        a look of ineffable tenderness, while Barrois, who had remained in the
        room in the character of a man privileged to know everything that passed,
        smiled on the youthful couple as he wiped the perspiration from his bald forehead.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How hot you look, my good Barrois,&rdquo; said Valentine.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, I have been running very fast, mademoiselle, but I must do M.
        Morrel the justice to say that he ran still faster.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Noirtier directed their attention to a waiter, on which was placed a decanter
        containing lemonade and a glass. The decanter was nearly full, with the
        exception of a little, which had been already drunk by M. Noirtier.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, Barrois,&rdquo; said the young girl, &ldquo;take some of this
        lemonade; I see you are coveting a good draught of it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The fact is, mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Barrois, &ldquo;I am dying
        with thirst, and since you are so kind as to offer it me, I cannot say I
        should at all object to drinking your health in a glass of it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Take some, then, and come back immediately.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Barrois took away the waiter, and hardly was he outside the door, which in his
        haste he forgot to shut, than they saw him throw back his head and empty to the
        very dregs the glass which Valentine had filled. Valentine and Morrel were
        exchanging their adieux in the presence of Noirtier when a ring was heard
        at the door-bell. It was the signal of a visit. Valentine looked at her
        watch.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is past noon,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and today is Saturday; I
        dare say it is the doctor, grandpapa.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Noirtier looked his conviction that she was right in her supposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He will come in here, and M. Morrel had better go,&mdash;do you not think
        so, grandpapa?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; signed the old man.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Barrois,&rdquo; cried Valentine, &ldquo;Barrois!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am coming, mademoiselle,&rdquo; replied he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Barrois will open the door for you,&rdquo; said Valentine,
        addressing Morrel. &ldquo;And now remember one thing, Monsieur Officer,
        that my grandfather commands you not to take any rash or ill-advised step
        which would be likely to compromise our happiness.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40108m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I promised him to wait,&rdquo; replied Morrel; &ldquo;and I will
        wait.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment Barrois entered. &ldquo;Who rang?&rdquo; asked Valentine.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Doctor d&rsquo;Avrigny,&rdquo; said Barrois, staggering as if he
        would fall.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is the matter, Barrois?&rdquo; said Valentine. The old man did
        not answer, but looked at his master with wild staring eyes, while with
        his cramped hand he grasped a piece of furniture to enable him to stand upright.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is going to fall!&rdquo; cried Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rigors which had attacked Barrois gradually increased, the features of the
        face became quite altered, and the convulsive movement of the muscles appeared
        to indicate the approach of a most serious nervous disorder. Noirtier, seeing
        Barrois in this pitiable condition, showed by his looks all the various
        emotions of sorrow and sympathy which can animate the heart of man.
        Barrois made some steps towards his master.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;tell me what is the matter with me.
        I am suffering&mdash;I cannot see. A thousand fiery darts are piercing my
        brain. Ah, don&rsquo;t touch me, pray don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        By this time his haggard eyes had the appearance of being ready to start from
        their sockets; his head fell back, and the lower extremities of the body began
        to stiffen. Valentine uttered a cry of horror; Morrel took her in his
        arms, as if to defend her from some unknown danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Avrigny, M. d&rsquo;Avrigny,&rdquo; cried she, in a stifled
        voice. &ldquo;Help, help!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Barrois turned round and with a great effort stumbled a few steps, then fell at
        the feet of Noirtier, and resting his hand on the knee of the invalid, exclaimed:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My master, my good master!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment M. de Villefort, attracted by the noise, appeared on the
        threshold. Morrel relaxed his hold of Valentine, and retreating to a
        distant corner of the room remained half hidden behind a curtain. Pale as
        if he had been gazing on a serpent, he fixed his terrified eye on the
        agonized sufferer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Noirtier, burning with impatience and terror, was in despair at his utter
        inability to help his old domestic, whom he regarded more in the light of
        a friend than a servant. One might by the fearful swelling of the veins of
        his forehead and the contraction of the muscles round the eye, trace the
        terrible conflict which was going on between the living energetic mind and
        the inanimate and helpless body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Barrois, his features convulsed, his eyes suffused with blood, and his head thrown
        back, was lying at full length, beating the floor with his hands, while his legs
        had become so stiff, that they looked as if they would break rather than bend.
        A slight appearance of foam was visible around the mouth, and he breathed
        painfully, and with extreme difficulty.
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort seemed stupefied with astonishment, and remained gazing intently
        on the scene before him without uttering a word. He had not seen Morrel.
        After a moment of dumb contemplation, during which his face became pale
        and his hair seemed to stand on end, he sprang towards the door, crying out:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Doctor, doctor! come instantly, pray come!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Madame, madame!&rdquo; cried Valentine, calling her step-mother,
        and running upstairs to meet her; &ldquo;come quick, quick!&mdash;and
        bring your bottle of smelling-salts with you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; said Madame de Villefort in a harsh and
        constrained tone.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh! come! come!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But where is the doctor?&rdquo; exclaimed Villefort; &ldquo;where
        is he?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame de Villefort now deliberately descended the staircase. In one hand she
        held her handkerchief, with which she appeared to be wiping her face, and in the
        other a bottle of English smelling-salts. Her first look on entering the room was
        at Noirtier, whose face, independent of the emotion which such a scene could not
        fail of producing, proclaimed him to be in possession of his usual health; her
        second glance was at the dying man. She turned pale, and her eye passed
        quickly from the servant and rested on the master.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In the name of heaven, madame,&rdquo; said Villefort, &ldquo;where
        is the doctor? He was with you just now. You see this is a fit of
        apoplexy, and he might be saved if he could but be bled!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Has he eaten anything lately?&rdquo; asked Madame de Villefort,
        eluding her husband&rsquo;s question.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; replied Valentine, &ldquo;he has not even breakfasted. He
        has been running very fast on an errand with which my grandfather charged him,
        and when he returned, took nothing but a glass of lemonade.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Madame de Villefort, &ldquo;why did he not take
        wine? Lemonade was a very bad thing for him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Grandpapa&rsquo;s bottle of lemonade was standing just by his side; poor
        Barrois was very thirsty, and was thankful to drink anything he could find.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame de Villefort started. Noirtier looked at her with a glance of the most
        profound scrutiny.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He has such a short neck,&rdquo; said she.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Villefort, &ldquo;I ask where is M. d&rsquo;Avrigny?
        In God&rsquo;s name answer me!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is with Edward, who is not quite well,&rdquo; replied Madame de
        Villefort, no longer being able to avoid answering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort rushed upstairs to fetch him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Take this,&rdquo; said Madame de Villefort, giving her smelling-bottle to
        Valentine. &ldquo;They will, no doubt, bleed him; therefore I will retire, for I
        cannot endure the sight of blood;&rdquo; and she followed her husband upstairs.
        Morrel now emerged from his hiding-place, where he had remained quite
        unperceived, so great had been the general confusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Go away as quick as you can, Maximilian,&rdquo; said Valentine,
        &ldquo;and stay till I send for you. Go.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel looked towards Noirtier for permission to retire. The old man, who
        had preserved all his usual coolness, made a sign to him to do so. The
        young man pressed Valentine&rsquo;s hand to his lips, and then left the
        house by a back staircase.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same moment that he quitted the room, Villefort and the doctor entered by
        an opposite door. Barrois was now showing signs of returning consciousness. The
        risis seemed past, a low moaning was heard, and he raised himself on one knee.
        D&rsquo;Avrigny and Villefort laid him on a couch.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you prescribe, doctor?&rdquo; demanded Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Give me some water and ether. You have some in the house, have you not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Send for some oil of turpentine and tartar emetic.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort immediately despatched a messenger. &ldquo;And now let everyone
        retire.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Must I go too?&rdquo; asked Valentine timidly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, mademoiselle, you especially,&rdquo; replied the doctor
        abruptly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine looked at M. d&rsquo;Avrigny with astonishment, kissed her
        grandfather on the forehead, and left the room. The doctor closed the door
        after her with a gloomy air.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Look, look, doctor,&rdquo; said Villefort, &ldquo;he is quite coming round
        again; I really do not think, after all, it is anything of consequence.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        M. d&rsquo;Avrigny answered by a melancholy smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How do you feel, Barrois?&rdquo; asked he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A little better, sir.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Will you drink some of this ether and water?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will try; but don&rsquo;t touch me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because I feel that if you were only to touch me with the tip of
        your finger the fit would return.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Drink.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Barrois took the glass, and, raising it to his purple lips, took about
        half of the liquid offered him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where do you suffer?&rdquo; asked the doctor.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Everywhere. I feel cramps over my whole body.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you find any dazzling sensation before the eyes?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Any noise in the ears?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Frightful.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40112m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;When did you first feel that?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Just now.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Suddenly?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, like a clap of thunder.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you feel nothing of it yesterday or the day before?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No drowsiness?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;None.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What have you eaten today?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have eaten nothing; I only drank a glass of my master&rsquo;s
        lemonade&mdash;that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo; And Barrois turned towards
        Noirtier, who, immovably fixed in his armchair, was contemplating this
        terrible scene without allowing a word or a movement to escape him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where is this lemonade?&rdquo; asked the doctor eagerly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Downstairs in the decanter.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Whereabouts downstairs?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In the kitchen.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall I go and fetch it, doctor?&rdquo; inquired Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, stay here and try to make Barrois drink the rest of this glass
        of ether and water. I will go myself and fetch the lemonade.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        D&rsquo;Avrigny bounded towards the door, flew down the back staircase, and almost
        knocked down Madame de Villefort, in his haste, who was herself going down to the
        kitchen. She cried out, but d&rsquo;Avrigny paid no attention to her;
        possessed with but one idea, he cleared the last four steps with a bound,
        and rushed into the kitchen, where he saw the decanter about three parts
        empty still standing on the waiter, where it had been left. He darted upon
        it as an eagle would seize upon its prey. Panting with loss of breath, he
        returned to the room he had just left. Madame de Villefort was slowly
        ascending the steps which led to her room.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is this the decanter you spoke of?&rdquo; asked d&rsquo;Avrigny.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, doctor.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is this the same lemonade of which you partook?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I believe so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What did it taste like?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It had a bitter taste.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The doctor poured some drops of the lemonade into the palm of his hand,
        put his lips to it, and after having rinsed his mouth as a man does when
        he is tasting wine, he spat the liquor into the fireplace.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is no doubt the same,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Did you drink some
        too, M. Noirtier?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And did you also discover a bitter taste?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, doctor,&rdquo; cried Barrois, &ldquo;the fit is coming on
        again. Oh, do something for me.&rdquo; The doctor flew to his patient.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That emetic, Villefort&mdash;see if it is coming.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort sprang into the passage, exclaiming, &ldquo;The emetic! the
        emetic!&mdash;is it come yet?&rdquo; No one answered. The most profound terror
        reigned throughout the house.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If I had anything by means of which I could inflate the lungs,&rdquo;
        said d&rsquo;Avrigny, looking around him, &ldquo;perhaps I might prevent
        suffocation. But there is nothing which would do!&mdash;nothing!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40114m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; cried Barrois, &ldquo;are you going to let me die
        without help? Oh, I am dying! Oh, save me!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A pen, a pen!&rdquo; said the doctor. There was one lying on the
        table; he endeavored to introduce it into the mouth of the patient, who,
        in the midst of his convulsions, was making vain attempts to vomit; but
        the jaws were so clenched that the pen could not pass them. This second
        attack was much more violent than the first, and he had slipped from the
        couch to the ground, where he was writhing in agony. The doctor left him
        in this paroxysm, knowing that he could do nothing to alleviate it, and,
        going up to Noirtier, said abruptly:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How do you find yourself?&mdash;well?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you any weight on the chest; or does your stomach feel light
        and comfortable&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you feel pretty much as you generally do after you have had
        the dose which I am accustomed to give you every Sunday?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did Barrois make your lemonade?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Was it you who asked him to drink some of it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Was it M. de Villefort?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Madame?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It was your granddaughter, then, was it not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        A groan from Barrois, accompanied by a yawn which seemed to crack the very
        jawbones, attracted the attention of M. d&rsquo;Avrigny; he left M. Noirtier, and
        returned to the sick man.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Barrois,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;can you speak?&rdquo; Barrois
        muttered a few unintelligible words. &ldquo;Try and make an effort to do so, my
        good man.&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Avrigny. Barrois reopened his bloodshot eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Who made the lemonade?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you bring it to your master directly it was made?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You left it somewhere, then, in the meantime?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; I left it in the pantry, because I was called away.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Who brought it into this room, then?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mademoiselle Valentine.&rdquo; D&rsquo;Avrigny struck his forehead
        with his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Gracious heaven,&rdquo; exclaimed he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Doctor, doctor!&rdquo; cried Barrois, who felt another fit coming.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Will they never bring that emetic?&rdquo; asked the doctor.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Here is a glass with one already prepared,&rdquo; said Villefort,
        entering the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Who prepared it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The chemist who came here with me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40116m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Drink it,&rdquo; said the doctor to Barrois.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Impossible, doctor; it is too late; my throat is closing up. I am choking!
        Oh, my heart! Ah, my head!&mdash;Oh, what agony!&mdash;Shall I suffer like this
        long?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no, friend,&rdquo; replied the doctor, &ldquo;you will soon
        cease to suffer.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, I understand you,&rdquo; said the unhappy man. &ldquo;My God,
        have mercy upon me!&rdquo; and, uttering a fearful cry, Barrois fell back
        as if he had been struck by lightning. D&rsquo;Avrigny put his hand to his
        heart, and placed a glass before his lips.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Go to the kitchen and get me some syrup of violets.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort went immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do not be alarmed, M. Noirtier,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Avrigny; &ldquo;I am
        going to take my patient into the next room to bleed him; this sort of attack is
        very frightful to witness.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And taking Barrois under the arms, he dragged him into an adjoining room;
        but almost immediately he returned to fetch the lemonade. Noirtier closed
        his right eye.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You want Valentine, do you not? I will tell them to send her to you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort returned, and d&rsquo;Avrigny met him in the passage.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, how is he now?&rdquo; asked he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come in here,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Avrigny, and he took him into the chamber
        where the sick man lay.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is he still in a fit?&rdquo; said the procureur.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is dead.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort drew back a few steps, and, clasping his hands, exclaimed, with
        real amazement and sympathy, &ldquo;Dead?&mdash;and so soon too!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, it is very soon,&rdquo; said the doctor, looking at the corpse
        before him; &ldquo;but that ought not to astonish you; Monsieur and Madame
        de Saint-M√©ran died as soon. People die very suddenly in your house, M. de
        Villefort.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried the magistrate, with an accent of horror and
        consternation, &ldquo;are you still harping on that terrible idea?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Still, sir; and I shall always do so,&rdquo; replied d&rsquo;Avrigny,
        &ldquo;for it has never for one instant ceased to retain possession of my
        mind; and that you may be quite sure I am not mistaken this time, listen
        well to what I am going to say, M. de Villefort.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The magistrate trembled convulsively.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There is a poison which destroys life almost without leaving any perceptible
        traces. I know it well; I have studied it in all its forms and in the effects which
        it produces. I recognized the presence of this poison in the case of poor Barrois
        as well as in that of Madame de Saint-M√©ran. There is a way of detecting its
        presence. It restores the blue color of litmus-paper reddened by an acid, and it
        turns syrup of violets green. We have no litmus-paper, but, see, here they come
        with the syrup of violets.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The doctor was right; steps were heard in the passage. M. d&rsquo;Avrigny
        opened the door, and took from the hands of the chambermaid a cup which
        contained two or three spoonfuls of the syrup, he then carefully closed the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said he to the procureur, whose heart beat
        so loudly that it might almost be heard, &ldquo;here is in this cup some
        syrup of violets, and this decanter contains the remainder of the lemonade
        of which M. Noirtier and Barrois partook. If the lemonade be pure and
        inoffensive, the syrup will retain its color; if, on the contrary, the
        lemonade be drugged with poison, the syrup will become green. Look
        closely!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The doctor then slowly poured some drops of the lemonade from the decanter
        into the cup, and in an instant a light cloudy sediment began to form at
        the bottom of the cup; this sediment first took a blue shade, then from
        the color of sapphire it passed to that of opal, and from opal to emerald.
        Arrived at this last hue, it changed no more. The result of the experiment
        left no doubt whatever on the mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The unfortunate Barrois has been poisoned,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Avrigny,
        &ldquo;and I will maintain this assertion before God and man.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort said nothing, but he clasped his hands, opened his haggard eyes,
        and, overcome with his emotion, sank into a chair.
