      <h2>Chapter 39. The Guests</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the house in the
        Rue du Helder, where Albert had invited the Count of Monte Cristo,
        everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st of May to do
        honor to the occasion. Albert de Morcerf inhabited a pavilion situated at
        the corner of a large court, and directly opposite another building, in
        which were the servants&rsquo; apartments. Two windows only of the
        pavilion faced the street; three other windows looked into the court, and
        two at the back into the garden.
      </p>
      <p>
        Between the court and the garden, built in the heavy style of the imperial
        architecture, was the large and fashionable dwelling of the Count and
        Countess of Morcerf.
      </p>
      <p>
        A high wall surrounded the whole of the property, surmounted at intervals
        by vases filled with flowers, and broken in the centre by a large gate of
        gilded iron, which served as the carriage entrance. A small door, close to
        the lodge of the <i>concierge</i>, gave ingress and egress to the servants
        and masters when they were on foot.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was easy to discover that the delicate care of a mother, unwilling to
        part from her son, and yet aware that a young man of the viscount&rsquo;s
        age required the full exercise of his liberty, had chosen this habitation
        for Albert. There were not lacking, however, evidences of what we may call
        the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent,
        careless life of an only son, and who lives as it were in a gilded cage.
        By means of the two windows looking into the street, Albert could see all
        that passed; the sight of what is going on is necessary to young men, who
        always want to see the world traverse their horizon, even if that horizon
        is only a public thoroughfare. Then, should anything appear to merit a
        more minute examination, Albert de Morcerf could follow up his researches
        by means of a small gate, similar to that close to the <i>concierge&rsquo;s</i>
        door, and which merits a particular description.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the
        house was built, so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt; but the
        well-oiled hinges and locks told quite another story. This door was a
        mockery to the <i>concierge</i>, from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it
        was free, and, like that famous portal in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>,
        opening at the &ldquo;<i>Sesame</i>&rdquo; of Ali Baba, it was wont to
        swing backward at a cabalistic word or a concerted tap from without from
        the sweetest voices or whitest fingers in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of a long corridor, with which the door communicated, and which
        formed the antechamber, was, on the right, Albert&rsquo;s breakfast-room,
        looking into the court, and on the left the salon, looking into the
        garden. Shrubs and creeping plants covered the windows, and hid from the
        garden and court these two apartments, the only rooms into which, as they
        were on the ground floor, the prying eyes of the curious could penetrate.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the floor above were similar rooms, with the addition of a third,
        formed out of the antechamber; these three rooms were a salon, a boudoir,
        and a bedroom. The salon downstairs was only an Algerian divan, for the
        use of smokers. The boudoir upstairs communicated with the bedchamber by
        an invisible door on the staircase; it was evident that every precaution
        had been taken. Above this floor was a large <i>atelier</i>, which had
        been increased in size by pulling down the partitions&mdash;a pandemonium,
        in which the artist and the dandy strove for pre-eminence.
      </p>
      <p>
        There were collected and piled up all Albert&rsquo;s successive caprices,
        hunting-horns, bass-viols, flutes&mdash;a whole orchestra, for Albert had
        had not a taste but a fancy for music; easels, palettes, brushes, pencils&mdash;for
        music had been succeeded by painting; foils, boxing-gloves, broadswords,
        and single-sticks&mdash;for, following the example of the fashionable
        young men of the time, Albert de Morcerf cultivated, with far more
        perseverance than music and drawing, the three arts that complete a dandy&rsquo;s
        education, i.e., fencing, boxing, and single-stick; and it was here that
        he received Grisier, Cooks, and Charles Leboucher.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old
        cabinets, filled with Chinese porcelain and Japanese vases, Lucca della
        Robbia <i>faïences</i>, and Palissy platters; of old armchairs, in which
        perhaps had sat Henry IV. or Sully, Louis XIII. or Richelieu&mdash;for two
        of these armchairs, adorned with a carved shield, on which were engraved
        the fleur-de-lis of France on an azure field, evidently came from the
        Louvre, or, at least, some royal residence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over these dark and sombre chairs were thrown splendid stuffs, dyed
        beneath Persia&rsquo;s sun, or woven by the fingers of the women of
        Calcutta or of Chandernagor. What these stuffs did there, it was
        impossible to say; they awaited, while gratifying the eyes, a destination
        unknown to their owner himself; in the meantime they filled the place with
        their golden and silky reflections.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the centre of the room was a Roller and Blanchet &ldquo;baby grand&rdquo;
        piano in rosewood, but holding the potentialities of an orchestra in its
        narrow and sonorous cavity, and groaning beneath the weight of the <i>chefs-d&rsquo;œuvre</i>
        of Beethoven, Weber, Mozart, Haydn, Grétry, and Porpora.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the walls, over the doors, on the ceiling, were swords, daggers, Malay
        creeses, maces, battle-axes; gilded, damasked, and inlaid suits of armor;
        dried plants, minerals, and stuffed birds, their flame-colored wings
        outspread in motionless flight, and their beaks forever open. This was
        Albert&rsquo;s favorite lounging place.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the morning of the appointment, the young man had established
        himself in the small salon downstairs. There, on a table, surrounded at
        some distance by a large and luxurious divan, every species of tobacco
        known,&mdash;from the yellow tobacco of Petersburg to the black of Sinai,
        and so on along the scale from Maryland and Porto Rico, to Latakia,&mdash;was
        exposed in pots of crackled earthenware of which the Dutch are so fond;
        beside them, in boxes of fragrant wood, were ranged, according to their
        size and quality, puros, regalias, havanas, and manillas; and, in an open
        cabinet, a collection of German pipes, of chibouques, with their amber
        mouth-pieces ornamented with coral, and of narghiles, with their long
        tubes of morocco, awaiting the caprice or the sympathy of the smokers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Albert had himself presided at the arrangement, or, rather, the
        symmetrical derangement, which, after coffee, the guests at a breakfast of
        modern days love to contemplate through the vapor that escapes from their
        mouths, and ascends in long and fanciful wreaths to the ceiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        At a quarter to ten, a valet entered; he composed, with a little groom
        named John, and who only spoke English, all Albert&rsquo;s establishment,
        although the cook of the hotel was always at his service, and on great
        occasions the count&rsquo;s <i>chasseur</i> also. This valet, whose name
        was Germain, and who enjoyed the entire confidence of his young master,
        held in one hand a number of papers, and in the other a packet of letters,
        which he gave to Albert. Albert glanced carelessly at the different
        missives, selected two written in a small and delicate hand, and enclosed
        in scented envelopes, opened them and perused their contents with some
        attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How did these letters come?&rdquo; said he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;One by the post, Madame Danglars&rsquo; footman left the other.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let Madame Danglars know that I accept the place she offers me in
        her box. Wait; then, during the day, tell Rosa that when I leave the Opera
        I will sup with her as she wishes. Take her six bottles of different wine&mdash;Cyprus,
        sherry, and Malaga, and a barrel of Ostend oysters; get them at Borel&rsquo;s,
        and be sure you say they are for me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At what o&rsquo;clock, sir, do you breakfast?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20227m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What time is it now?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A quarter to ten.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well, at half past ten. Debray will, perhaps, be obliged to go
        to the minister&mdash;and besides&rdquo; (Albert looked at his tablets),
        &ldquo;it is the hour I told the count, 21st May, at half past ten; and
        though I do not much rely upon his promise, I wish to be punctual. Is the
        countess up yet?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If you wish, I will inquire.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, ask her for one of her <i>liqueur</i> cellarets, mine is
        incomplete; and tell her I shall have the honor of seeing her about three
        o&rsquo;clock, and that I request permission to introduce someone to her.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The valet left the room. Albert threw himself on the divan, tore off the
        cover of two or three of the papers, looked at the theatre announcements,
        made a face seeing they gave an opera, and not a ballet; hunted vainly
        amongst the advertisements for a new tooth-powder of which he had heard,
        and threw down, one after the other, the three leading papers of Paris,
        muttering,
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;These papers become more and more stupid every day.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        A moment after, a carriage stopped before the door, and the servant announced M.
        Lucien Debray. A tall young man, with light hair, clear gray eyes, and
        thin and compressed lips, dressed in a blue coat with beautifully carved
        gold buttons, a white neckcloth, and a tortoiseshell eye-glass suspended
        by a silken thread, and which, by an effort of the superciliary and
        zygomatic muscles, he fixed in his eye, entered, with a half-official air,
        without smiling or speaking.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Good-morning, Lucien, good-morning,&rdquo; said Albert; &ldquo;your
        punctuality really alarms me. What do I say? punctuality! You, whom I expected
        last, you arrive at five minutes to ten, when the time fixed was half-past!
        Has the ministry resigned?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, my dear fellow,&rdquo; returned the young man, seating himself
        on the divan; &ldquo;reassure yourself; we are tottering always, but we
        never fall, and I begin to believe that we shall pass into a state of
        immobility, and then the affairs of the Peninsula will completely
        consolidate us.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, true; you drive Don Carlos out of Spain.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no, my dear fellow, do not confound our plans. We take him to
        the other side of the French frontier, and offer him hospitality at
        Bourges.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At Bourges?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, he has not much to complain of; Bourges is the capital of
        Charles VII. Do you not know that all Paris knew it yesterday, and the day
        before it had already transpired on the Bourse, and M. Danglars (I do not
        know by what means that man contrives to obtain intelligence as soon as we
        do) made a million!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you another order, for I see you have a blue ribbon at your
        button-hole.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; they sent me the order of Charles III.,&rdquo; returned
        Debray carelessly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, do not affect indifference, but confess you were pleased to
        have it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, it is very well as a finish to the toilet. It looks very neat
        on a black coat buttoned up.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And makes you resemble the Prince of Wales or the Duke of
        Reichstadt.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is for that reason you see me so early.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because you have the order of Charles III., and you wish to
        announce the good news to me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, because I passed the night writing letters,&mdash;five-and-twenty
        despatches. I returned home at daybreak, and strove to sleep; but
        my head ached and I got up to have a ride for an hour. At the Bois de
        Boulogne, <i>ennui</i> and hunger attacked me at once,&mdash;two enemies
        who rarely accompany each other, and who are yet leagued against me, a
        sort of Carlo-republican alliance. I then recollected you gave a breakfast
        this morning, and here I am. I am hungry, feed me; I am bored, amuse me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is my duty as your host,&rdquo; returned Albert, ringing the
        bell, while Lucien turned over, with his gold-mounted cane, the papers
        that lay on the table. &ldquo;Germain, a glass of sherry and a biscuit. In
        the meantime, my dear Lucien, here are cigars&mdash;contraband, of course&mdash;try
        them, and persuade the minister to sell us such instead of poisoning us
        with cabbage leaves.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Peste!</i> I will do nothing of the kind; the moment they come
        from government you would find them execrable. Besides, that does not
        concern the home but the financial department. Address yourself to M.
        Humann, section of the indirect contributions, corridor A., No. 26.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On my word,&rdquo; said Albert, &ldquo;you astonish me by the
        extent of your knowledge. Take a cigar.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Really, my dear Albert,&rdquo; replied Lucien, lighting a manilla
        at a rose-colored taper that burnt in a beautifully enamelled stand&mdash;&ldquo;how
        happy you are to have nothing to do. You do not know your own good
        fortune!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what would you do, my dear diplomatist,&rdquo; replied Morcerf,
        with a slight degree of irony in his voice, &ldquo;if you did nothing?
        What? private secretary to a minister, plunged at once into European
        cabals and Parisian intrigues; having kings, and, better still, queens, to
        protect, parties to unite, elections to direct; making more use of your
        cabinet with your pen and your telegraph than Napoleon did of his
        battle-fields with his sword and his victories; possessing five-and-twenty
        thousand francs a year, besides your place; a horse, for which
        Château-Renaud offered you four hundred louis, and which you would not
        part with; a tailor who never disappoints you; with the opera, the
        jockey-club, and other diversions, can you not amuse yourself? Well, I
        will amuse you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By introducing to you a new acquaintance.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A man or a woman?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A man.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I know so many men already.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But you do not know this man.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where does he come from&mdash;the end of the world?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Farther still, perhaps.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The deuce! I hope he does not bring our breakfast with him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no; our breakfast comes from my father&rsquo;s kitchen. Are you
        hungry?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Humiliating as such a confession is, I am. But I dined at M. de
        Villefort&rsquo;s, and lawyers always give you very bad dinners. You would
        think they felt some remorse; did you ever remark that?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, depreciate other persons&rsquo; dinners; you ministers give
        such splendid ones.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; but we do not invite people of fashion. If we were not forced
        to entertain a parcel of country boobies because they think and vote with
        us, we should never dream of dining at home, I assure you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, take another glass of sherry and another biscuit.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Willingly. Your Spanish wine is excellent. You see we were quite
        right to pacify that country.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; but Don Carlos?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, Don Carlos will drink Bordeaux, and in ten years we will
        marry his son to the little queen.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You will then obtain the Golden Fleece, if you are still in the
        ministry.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I think, Albert, you have adopted the system of feeding me on smoke
        this morning.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, you must allow it is the best thing for the stomach; but I
        hear Beauchamp in the next room; you can dispute together, and that will
        pass away the time.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;About what?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;About the papers.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; said Lucien with an air of sovereign
        contempt, &ldquo;do I ever read the papers?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you will dispute the more.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. Beauchamp,&rdquo; announced the servant. &ldquo;Come in, come
        in,&rdquo; said Albert, rising and advancing to meet the young man.
        &ldquo;Here is Debray, who detests you without reading you, so he says.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is quite right,&rdquo; returned Beauchamp; &ldquo;for I
        criticise him without knowing what he does. Good-day, commander!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, you know that already,&rdquo; said the private secretary,
        smiling and shaking hands with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Pardieu!</i>&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what do they say of it in the world?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In which world? we have so many worlds in the year of grace 1838.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In the entire political world, of which you are one of the leaders.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They say that it is quite fair, and that sowing so much red, you
        ought to reap a little blue.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, come, that is not bad!&rdquo; said Lucien. &ldquo;Why do you
        not join our party, my dear Beauchamp? With your talents you would make
        your fortune in three or four years.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I only await one thing before following your advice; that is, a
        minister who will hold office for six months. My dear Albert, one word,
        for I must give poor Lucien a respite. Do we breakfast or dine? I must go
        to the Chamber, for our life is not an idle one.&rdquo;

        &ldquo;You only breakfast; I await two persons, and the instant they
        arrive we shall sit down to table.&rdquo;
