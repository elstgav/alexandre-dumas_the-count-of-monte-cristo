      <h2>Chapter 94. Maximilian&rsquo;s Avowal</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t the same moment
        M. de Villefort&rsquo;s voice was heard calling from his study, &ldquo;What
        is the matter?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel looked at Noirtier who had recovered his self-command, and with a glance
        indicated the closet where once before under somewhat similar circumstances, he
        had taken refuge. He had only time to get his hat and throw himself breathless
        into the closet when the procureur&rsquo;s footstep was heard in the passage.
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort sprang into the room, ran to Valentine, and took her in his arms.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A physician, a physician,&mdash;M. d&rsquo;Avrigny!&rdquo; cried
        Villefort; &ldquo;or rather I will go for him myself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He flew from the apartment, and Morrel at the same moment darted out at the other
        door. He had been struck to the heart by a frightful recollection&mdash;the
        conversation he had heard between the doctor and Villefort the night of Madame
        de Saint-Méran&rsquo;s death, recurred to him; these symptoms, to a less alarming
        extent, were the same which had preceded the death of Barrois. At the same time
        Monte Cristo&rsquo;s voice seemed to resound in his ear with the words he had
        heard only two hours before, &ldquo;Whatever you want, Morrel, come to me;
        I have great power.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        More rapidly than thought, he darted down the Rue Matignon, and thence to the
        Avenue des Champs-Élysées.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile M. de Villefort arrived in a hired cabriolet at M. d&rsquo;Avrigny&rsquo;s
        door. He rang so violently that the porter was alarmed. Villefort ran
        upstairs without saying a word. The porter knew him, and let him pass,
        only calling to him:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In his study, Monsieur Procureur&mdash;in his study!&rdquo; Villefort
        pushed, or rather forced, the door open.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;is it you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Villefort, closing the door after him, &ldquo;it
        is I, who am come in my turn to ask you if we are quite alone. Doctor, my
        house is accursed!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said the latter with apparent coolness, but with deep
        emotion, &ldquo;have you another invalid?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, doctor,&rdquo; cried Villefort, clutching his hair, &ldquo;yes!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        D&rsquo;Avrigny&rsquo;s look implied, &ldquo;I told you it would be so.&rdquo;
        Then he slowly uttered these words, &ldquo;Who is now dying in your house?
        What new victim is going to accuse you of weakness before God?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        A mournful sob burst from Villefort&rsquo;s heart; he approached the doctor,
        and seizing his arm,&mdash;&ldquo;Valentine,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is
        Valentine&rsquo;s turn!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40284m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your daughter!&rdquo; cried d&rsquo;Avrigny with grief and
        surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You see you were deceived,&rdquo; murmured the magistrate; &ldquo;come
        and see her, and on her bed of agony entreat her pardon for having
        suspected her.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Each time you have applied to me,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;it
        has been too late; still I will go. But let us make haste, sir; with the
        enemies you have to do with there is no time to be lost.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, this time, doctor, you shall not have to reproach me with
        weakness. This time I will know the assassin, and will pursue him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us try first to save the victim before we think of revenging
        her,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Avrigny. &ldquo;Come.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The same cabriolet which had brought Villefort took them back at full speed, and
        at this moment Morrel rapped at Monte Cristo&rsquo;s door.
      </p>
      <p>
        The count was in his study and was reading with an angry look something which
        Bertuccio had brought in haste. Hearing the name of Morrel, who had left him
        only two hours before, the count raised his head, arose, and sprang to meet him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is the matter, Maximilian?&rdquo; asked he; &ldquo;you are
        pale, and the perspiration rolls from your forehead.&rdquo; Morrel fell
        into a chair.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I came quickly; I wanted to speak to you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are all your family well?&rdquo; asked the count, with an
        affectionate benevolence, whose sincerity no one could for a moment doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you, count&mdash;thank you,&rdquo; said the young man,
        evidently embarrassed how to begin the conversation; &ldquo;yes, everyone
        in my family is well.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So much the better; yet you have something to tell me?&rdquo;
        replied the count with increased anxiety.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Morrel, &ldquo;it is true; I have but now left a
        house where death has just entered, to run to you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you then come from M. de Morcerf&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked Monte
        Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Morrel; &ldquo;is someone dead in his house?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The general has just blown his brains out,&rdquo; replied Monte
        Cristo with great coolness.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, what a dreadful event!&rdquo; cried Maximilian.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not for the countess, or for Albert,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo;
        &ldquo;a dead father or husband is better than a dishonored one,&mdash;blood
        washes out shame.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Poor countess,&rdquo; said Maximilian, &ldquo;I pity her very much;
        she is so noble a woman!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Pity Albert also, Maximilian; for believe me he is the worthy son
        of the countess. But let us return to yourself. You have hastened to me&mdash;can
        I have the happiness of being useful to you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40286m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I need your help: that is I thought like a madman that you
        could lend me your assistance in a case where God alone can succor me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Tell me what it is,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Morrel, &ldquo;I know not, indeed, if I may reveal
        this secret to mortal ears, but fatality impels me, necessity constrains
        me, count&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Morrel hesitated.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you think I love you?&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, taking the young
        man&rsquo;s hand affectionately in his.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, you encourage me, and something tells me there,&rdquo; placing
        his hand on his heart, &ldquo;that I ought to have no secret from you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are right, Morrel; God is speaking to your heart, and your
        heart speaks to you. Tell me what it says.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Count, will you allow me to send Baptistin to inquire after someone
        you know?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am at your service, and still more my servants.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I cannot live if she is not better.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall I ring for Baptistin?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I will go and speak to him myself.&rdquo; Morrel went out,
        called Baptistin, and whispered a few words to him. The valet ran
        directly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, have you sent?&rdquo; asked Monte Cristo, seeing Morrel
        return.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, and now I shall be more calm.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You know I am waiting,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, smiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, and I will tell you. One evening I was in a garden; a clump of
        trees concealed me; no one suspected I was there. Two persons passed near
        me&mdash;allow me to conceal their names for the present; they were
        speaking in an undertone, and yet I was so interested in what they said
        that I did not lose a single word.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This is a gloomy introduction, if I may judge from your pallor and
        shuddering, Morrel.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, very gloomy, my friend. Someone had just died in the house
        to which that garden belonged. One of the persons whose conversation I
        overheard was the master of the house; the other, the physician. The
        former was confiding to the latter his grief and fear, for it was the
        second time within a month that death had suddenly and unexpectedly
        entered that house which was apparently destined to destruction by some
        exterminating angel, as an object of God&rsquo;s anger.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, indeed?&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, looking earnestly at the
        young man, and by an imperceptible movement turning his chair, so that he
        remained in the shade while the light fell full on Maximilian&rsquo;s face.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; continued Morrel, &ldquo;death had entered that
        house twice within one month.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what did the doctor answer?&rdquo; asked Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He replied&mdash;he replied, that the death was not a natural one,
        and must be attributed&rdquo;&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To what?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To poison.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Monte Cristo with a slight cough which in
        moments of extreme emotion helped him to disguise a blush, or his pallor,
        or the intense interest with which he listened; &ldquo;indeed, Maximilian,
        did you hear that?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, my dear count, I heard it; and the doctor added that if
        another death occurred in a similar way he must appeal to justice.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo listened, or appeared to do so, with the greatest calmness.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Maximilian, &ldquo;death came a third time, and
        neither the master of the house nor the doctor said a word. Death is now,
        perhaps, striking a fourth blow. Count, what am I bound to do, being in
        possession of this secret?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, &ldquo;you appear to be
        relating an adventure which we all know by heart. I know the house where
        you heard it, or one very similar to it; a house with a garden, a master,
        a physician, and where there have been three unexpected and sudden deaths.
        Well, I have not intercepted your confidence, and yet I know all that as
        well as you, and I have no conscientious scruples. No, it does not concern
        me. You say an exterminating angel appears to have devoted that house to
        God&rsquo;s anger&mdash;well, who says your supposition is not reality? Do
        not notice things which those whose interest it is to see them pass over.
        If it is God&rsquo;s justice, instead of his anger, which is walking
        through that house, Maximilian, turn away your face and let his justice
        accomplish its purpose.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel shuddered. There was something mournful, solemn, and terrible in the
        count&rsquo;s manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; continued he, in so changed a tone that no one would have
        supposed it was the same person speaking&mdash;&ldquo;besides, who says that it
        will begin again?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It has returned, count,&rdquo; exclaimed Morrel; &ldquo;that is why
        I hastened to you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what do you wish me to do? Do you wish me, for instance, to
        give information to the procureur?&rdquo; Monte Cristo uttered the last
        words with so much meaning that Morrel, starting up, cried out:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You know of whom I speak, count, do you not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Perfectly well, my good friend; and I will prove it to you by
        putting the dots to the <i>i</i>, or rather by naming the persons. You
        were walking one evening in M. de Villefort&rsquo;s garden; from what you
        relate, I suppose it to have been the evening of Madame de Saint-Méran&rsquo;s
        death. You heard M. de Villefort talking to M. d&rsquo;Avrigny about the
        death of M. de Saint-Méran, and that no less surprising, of the countess.
        M. d&rsquo;Avrigny said he believed they both proceeded from poison; and
        you, honest man, have ever since been asking your heart and sounding your
        conscience to know if you ought to expose or conceal this secret. We are
        no longer in the Middle Ages; there is no longer a Vehmgericht, or Free
        Tribunals; what do you want to ask these people? &lsquo;Conscience, what
        hast thou to do with me?&rsquo; as Sterne said. My dear fellow, let them
        sleep on, if they are asleep; let them grow pale in their drowsiness, if
        they are disposed to do so, and pray do you remain in peace, who have no
        remorse to disturb you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Deep grief was depicted on Morrel&rsquo;s features; he seized Monte Cristo&rsquo;s
        hand. &ldquo;But it is beginning again, I say!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the Count, astonished at his perseverance, which
        he could not understand, and looking still more earnestly at Maximilian,
        &ldquo;let it begin again,&mdash;it is like the house of the
        Atreidae;<a href="#linknote-19" name="linknoteref-19" id="linknoteref-19">19</a> God
        has condemned them, and they must submit to their punishment. They
        will all disappear, like the fabrics children build with cards, and which
        fall, one by one, under the breath of their builder, even if there are two
        hundred of them. Three months since it was M. de Saint-Méran; Madame de
        Saint-Méran two months since; the other day it was Barrois; today, the old
        Noirtier, or young Valentine.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You knew it?&rdquo; cried Morrel, in such a paroxysm of terror that
        Monte Cristo started,&mdash;he whom the falling heavens would have found
        unmoved; &ldquo;you knew it, and said nothing?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what is it to me?&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo, shrugging his
        shoulders; &ldquo;do I know those people? and must I lose the one to save
        the other? Faith, no, for between the culprit and the victim I have no
        choice.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But I,&rdquo; cried Morrel, groaning with sorrow, &ldquo;I love
        her!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You love?&mdash;whom?&rdquo; cried Monte Cristo, starting to his
        feet, and seizing the two hands which Morrel was raising towards heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I love most fondly&mdash;I love madly&mdash;I love as a man who
        would give his life-blood to spare her a tear&mdash;I love Valentine de
        Villefort, who is being murdered at this moment! Do you understand me? I
        love her; and I ask God and you how I can save her?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo uttered a cry which those only can conceive who have heard the roar
        of a wounded lion. &ldquo;Unhappy man,&rdquo; cried he, wringing his hands in
        his turn; &ldquo;you love Valentine,&mdash;that daughter of an accursed
        race!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Never had Morrel witnessed such an expression&mdash;never had so terrible an eye
        flashed before his face&mdash;never had the genius of terror he had so often seen,
        either on the battle-field or in the murderous nights of Algeria, shaken around
        him more dreadful fire. He drew back terrified.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for Monte Cristo, after this ebullition he closed his eyes as if
        dazzled by internal light. In a moment he restrained himself so powerfully
        that the tempestuous heaving of his breast subsided, as turbulent and
        foaming waves yield to the sun&rsquo;s genial influence when the cloud has
        passed. This silence, self-control, and struggle lasted about twenty
        seconds, then the count raised his pallid face.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;See,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my dear friend, how God punishes the most
        thoughtless and unfeeling men for their indifference, by presenting dreadful scenes
        to their view. I, who was looking on, an eager and curious spectator,&mdash;I,
        who was watching the working of this mournful tragedy,&mdash;I, who like a
        wicked angel was laughing at the evil men committed protected by secrecy
        (a secret is easily kept by the rich and powerful), I am in my turn bitten
        by the serpent whose tortuous course I was watching, and bitten to the
        heart!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel groaned.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; continued the count, &ldquo;complaints are unavailing,
        be a man, be strong, be full of hope, for I am here and will watch over you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel shook his head sorrowfully.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I tell you to hope. Do you understand me?&rdquo; cried Monte Cristo.
        &ldquo;Remember that I never uttered a falsehood and am never deceived. It is
        twelve o&rsquo;clock, Maximilian; thank heaven that you came at noon rather than
        in the evening, or tomorrow morning. Listen, Morrel&mdash;it is noon; if Valentine
        is not now dead, she will not die.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How so?&rdquo; cried Morrel, &ldquo;when I left her dying?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo pressed his hands to his forehead. What was passing in that
        brain, so loaded with dreadful secrets? What does the angel of light or
        the angel of darkness say to that mind, at once implacable and generous?
        God only knows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo raised his head once more, and this time he was calm as a
        child awaking from its sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Maximilian,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;return home. I command you not to
        stir&mdash;attempt nothing, not to let your countenance betray a thought, and
        I will send you tidings. Go.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, count, you overwhelm me with that coolness. Have you, then,
        power against death? Are you superhuman? Are you an angel?&rdquo; And the
        young man, who had never shrunk from danger, shrank before Monte Cristo
        with indescribable terror. But Monte Cristo looked at him with so
        melancholy and sweet a smile, that Maximilian felt the tears filling his
        eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I can do much for you, my friend,&rdquo; replied the count. &ldquo;Go;
        I must be alone.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel, subdued by the extraordinary ascendancy Monte Cristo exercised
        over everything around him, did not endeavor to resist it. He pressed the
        count&rsquo;s hand and left. He stopped one moment at the door for
        Baptistin, whom he saw in the Rue Matignon, and who was running.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, Villefort and d&rsquo;Avrigny had made all possible haste,
        Valentine had not revived from her fainting fit on their arrival, and the
        doctor examined the invalid with all the care the circumstances demanded,
        and with an interest which the knowledge of the secret intensified
        twofold. Villefort, closely watching his countenance and his lips, awaited
        the result of the examination. Noirtier, paler than even the young girl,
        more eager than Villefort for the decision, was watching also intently and
        affectionately.
      </p>
      <p>
        At last d&rsquo;Avrigny slowly uttered these words: &ldquo;She is
        still alive!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Still?&rdquo; cried Villefort; &ldquo;oh, doctor, what a dreadful
        word is that.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the physician, &ldquo;I repeat it; she is still
        alive, and I am astonished at it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But is she safe?&rdquo; asked the father.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, since she lives.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment d&rsquo;Avrigny&rsquo;s glance met Noirtier&rsquo;s eye. It
        glistened with such extraordinary joy, so rich and full of thought, that the
        physician was struck. He placed the young girl again on the chair,&mdash;her lips
        were scarcely discernible, they were so pale and white, as well as her whole
        face,&mdash;and remained motionless, looking at Noirtier, who appeared to
        anticipate and commend all he did.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Avrigny to Villefort, &ldquo;call Mademoiselle
        Valentine&rsquo;s maid, if you please.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort went himself to find her; and d&rsquo;Avrigny approached Noirtier.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you something to tell me?&rdquo; asked he. The old man winked his
        eyes expressively, which we may remember was his only way of expressing his
        approval.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Privately?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I will remain with you.&rdquo; At this moment Villefort
        returned, followed by the lady&rsquo;s maid; and after her came Madame de
        Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is the matter, then, with this dear child? she has just left
        me, and she complained of being indisposed, but I did not think seriously
        of it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The young woman with tears in her eyes and every mark of affection of a true
        mother, approached Valentine and took her hand. D&rsquo;Avrigny continued to look
        at Noirtier; he saw the eyes of the old man dilate and become round, his cheeks
        turn pale and tremble; the perspiration stood in drops upon his forehead.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, involuntarily following Noirtier&rsquo;s eyes, which
        were fixed on Madame de Villefort, who repeated:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This poor child would be better in bed. Come, Fanny, we will put her to
        bed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        M. d&rsquo;Avrigny, who saw that would be a means of his remaining alone with
        Noirtier, expressed his opinion that it was the best thing that could be done;
        but he forbade that anything should be given to her except what he ordered.
      </p>
      <p>
        They carried Valentine away; she had revived, but could scarcely move or
        speak, so shaken was her frame by the attack. She had, however, just power
        to give one parting look to her grandfather, who in losing her seemed to
        be resigning his very soul. D&rsquo;Avrigny followed the invalid, wrote a
        prescription, ordered Villefort to take a cabriolet, go in person to a
        chemist&rsquo;s to get the prescribed medicine, bring it himself, and wait
        for him in his daughter&rsquo;s room. Then, having renewed his injunction
        not to give Valentine anything, he went down again to Noirtier, shut the
        doors carefully, and after convincing himself that no one was listening:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;know anything of this young lady&rsquo;s
        illness?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We have no time to lose; I will question, and do you answer me.&rdquo;
        Noirtier made a sign that he was ready to answer. &ldquo;Did you
        anticipate the accident which has happened to your granddaughter?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; D&rsquo;Avrigny reflected a moment; then approaching
        Noirtier:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Pardon what I am going to say,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;but no indication
        should be neglected in this terrible situation. Did you see poor Barrois
        die?&rdquo; Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know of what he died!&rdquo; asked d&rsquo;Avrigny, placing his
        hand on Noirtier&rsquo;s shoulder.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the old man.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you think he died a natural death?&rdquo; A sort of smile was
        discernible on the motionless lips of Noirtier.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you have thought that Barrois was poisoned?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you think the poison he fell a victim to was intended for him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you think the same hand which unintentionally struck Barrois has
        now attacked Valentine?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then will she die too?&rdquo; asked d&rsquo;Avrigny, fixing his
        penetrating gaze on Noirtier. He watched the effect of this question on
        the old man.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied he with an air of triumph which would have puzzled the
        most clever diviner.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you hope?&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Avrigny, with surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you hope?&rdquo; The old man made him understand with his
        eyes that he could not answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, yes, it is true,&rdquo; murmured d&rsquo;Avrigny. Then, turning to
        Noirtier,&mdash;&ldquo;Do you hope the assassin will be tried?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you hope the poison will take no effect on Valentine?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is no news to you,&rdquo; added d&rsquo;Avrigny, &ldquo;to tell
        you that an attempt has been made to poison her?&rdquo; The old man made a
        sign that he entertained no doubt upon the subject. &ldquo;Then how do you
        hope Valentine will escape?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Noirtier kept his eyes steadfastly fixed on the same spot. D&rsquo;Avrigny followed
        the direction and saw that they were fixed on a bottle containing the mixture which
        he took every morning. &ldquo;Ah, indeed?&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Avrigny, struck with
        a sudden thought, &ldquo;has it occurred to you&rdquo;&mdash;Noirtier did
        not let him finish.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To prepare her system to resist poison?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By accustoming her by degrees&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes,&rdquo; said Noirtier, delighted to be understood.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course. I had told you that there was brucine in the mixture I
        give you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And by accustoming her to that poison, you have endeavored to
        neutralize the effect of a similar poison?&rdquo; Noirtier&rsquo;s joy
        continued. &ldquo;And you have succeeded,&rdquo; exclaimed d&rsquo;Avrigny.
        &ldquo;Without that precaution Valentine would have died before assistance
        could have been procured. The dose has been excessive, but she has only
        been shaken by it; and this time, at any rate, Valentine will not die.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        A superhuman joy expanded the old man&rsquo;s eyes, which were raised
        towards heaven with an expression of infinite gratitude. At this moment
        Villefort returned.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Here, doctor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is what you sent me for.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Was this prepared in your presence?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the procureur.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you not let it go out of your hands?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        D&rsquo;Avrigny took the bottle, poured some drops of the mixture it
        contained in the hollow of his hand, and swallowed them.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let us go to Valentine; I will give
        instructions to everyone, and you, M. de Villefort, will yourself see that no
        one deviates from them.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40294m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        At the moment when d&rsquo;Avrigny was returning to Valentine&rsquo;s
        room, accompanied by Villefort, an Italian priest, of serious demeanor and
        calm and firm tone, hired for his use the house adjoining the hotel of M.
        de Villefort. No one knew how the three former tenants of that house left
        it. About two hours afterwards its foundation was reported to be unsafe;
        but the report did not prevent the new occupant establishing himself there
        with his modest furniture the same day at five o&rsquo;clock. The lease
        was drawn up for three, six, or nine years by the new tenant, who,
        according to the rule of the proprietor, paid six months in advance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This new tenant, who, as we have said, was an Italian, was called Il
        Signor Giacomo Busoni. Workmen were immediately called in, and that same
        night the passengers at the end of the faubourg saw with surprise that
        carpenters and masons were occupied in repairing the lower part of the
        tottering house.
