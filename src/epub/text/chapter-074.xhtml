      <h2>Chapter 74. The Villefort Family Vault</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>wo days after, a
        considerable crowd was assembled, towards ten o&rsquo;clock in the
        morning, around the door of M. de Villefort&rsquo;s house, and a long file
        of mourning-coaches and private carriages extended along the Faubourg
        Saint-Honoré and the Rue de la Pépinière. Among them was one of a very
        singular form, which appeared to have come from a distance. It was a kind
        of covered wagon, painted black, and was one of the first to arrive.
        Inquiry was made, and it was ascertained that, by a strange coincidence,
        this carriage contained the corpse of the Marquis de Saint-Méran, and that
        those who had come thinking to attend one funeral would follow two. Their
        number was great. The Marquis de Saint-Méran, one of the most zealous and
        faithful dignitaries of Louis XVIII. and King Charles X., had preserved a
        great number of friends, and these, added to the personages whom the
        usages of society gave Villefort a claim on, formed a considerable body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due information was given to the authorities, and permission obtained that
        the two funerals should take place at the same time. A second hearse,
        decked with the same funereal pomp, was brought to M. de Villefort&rsquo;s
        door, and the coffin removed into it from the post-wagon. The two bodies
        were to be interred in the cemetery of Père-Lachaise, where M. de
        Villefort had long since had a tomb prepared for the reception of his
        family. The remains of poor Renée were already deposited there, and now,
        after ten years of separation, her father and mother were to be reunited
        with her.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Parisians, always curious, always affected by funereal display, looked
        on with religious silence while the splendid procession accompanied to
        their last abode two of the number of the old aristocracy&mdash;the
        greatest protectors of commerce and sincere devotees to their principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        In one of the mourning-coaches Beauchamp, Debray, and Château-Renaud were
        talking of the very sudden death of the marchioness.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I saw Madame de Saint-Méran only last year at Marseilles, when I was coming
        back from Algiers,&rdquo; said Château-Renaud; &ldquo;she looked like a woman
        destined to live to be a hundred years old, from her apparent sound health
        and great activity of mind and body. How old was she?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Franz assured me,&rdquo; replied Albert, &ldquo;that she was
        sixty-six years old. But she has not died of old age, but of grief; it
        appears that since the death of the marquis, which affected her very
        deeply, she has not completely recovered her reason.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But of what disease, then, did she die?&rdquo; asked Debray.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is said to have been a congestion of the brain, or apoplexy,
        which is the same thing, is it not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nearly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is difficult to believe that it was apoplexy,&rdquo; said
        Beauchamp. &ldquo;Madame de Saint-Méran, whom I once saw, was short, of
        slender form, and of a much more nervous than sanguine temperament; grief
        could hardly produce apoplexy in such a constitution as that of Madame de
        Saint-Méran.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; said Albert, &ldquo;whatever disease or doctor
        may have killed her, M. de Villefort, or rather, Mademoiselle Valentine,&mdash;or,
        still rather, our friend Franz, inherits a magnificent fortune, amounting,
        I believe, to 80,000 livres per annum.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And this fortune will be doubled at the death of the old Jacobin,
        Noirtier.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is a tenacious old grandfather,&rdquo; said Beauchamp. &ldquo;<i>Tenacem
        propositi virum</i>. I think he must have made an agreement with death to
        outlive all his heirs, and he appears likely to succeed. He resembles the
        old Conventionalist of &rsquo;93, who said to Napoleon, in 1814, &lsquo;You
        bend because your empire is a young stem, weakened by rapid growth. Take
        the Republic for a tutor; let us return with renewed strength to the
        battle-field, and I promise you 500,000 soldiers, another Marengo, and a
        second Austerlitz. Ideas do not become extinct, sire; they slumber
        sometimes, but only revive the stronger before they sleep entirely.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ideas and men appeared the same to him,&rdquo; said Albert. &ldquo;One
        thing only puzzles me, namely, how Franz d&rsquo;Épinay will like a grandfather
        who cannot be separated from his wife. But where is Franz?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In the first carriage, with M. de Villefort, who considers him
        already as one of the family.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40024m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        Such was the conversation in almost all the carriages; these two sudden
        deaths, so quickly following each other, astonished everyone, but no one
        suspected the terrible secret which M. d&rsquo;Avrigny had communicated,
        in his nocturnal walk to M. de Villefort. They arrived in about an hour at
        the cemetery; the weather was mild, but dull, and in harmony with the
        funeral ceremony. Among the groups which flocked towards the family vault,
        Château-Renaud recognized Morrel, who had come alone in a cabriolet, and
        walked silently along the path bordered with yew-trees.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You here?&rdquo; said Château-Renaud, passing his arms through the young
        captain&rsquo;s; &ldquo;are you a friend of Villefort&rsquo;s? How is it that I
        have never met you at his house?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am no acquaintance of M. de Villefort&rsquo;s,&rdquo; answered
        Morrel, &ldquo;but I was of Madame de Saint-Méran.&rdquo; Albert came up
        to them at this moment with Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The time and place are but ill-suited for an introduction.&rdquo;
        said Albert; &ldquo;but we are not superstitious. M. Morrel, allow me to
        present to you M. Franz d&rsquo;Épinay, a delightful travelling companion,
        with whom I made the tour of Italy. My dear Franz, M. Maximilian Morrel,
        an excellent friend I have acquired in your absence, and whose name you will hear
        me mention every time I make any allusion to affection, wit, or amiability.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel hesitated for a moment; he feared it would be hypocritical to accost in a
        friendly manner the man whom he was tacitly opposing, but his oath and the gravity
        of the circumstances recurred to his memory; he struggled to conceal his emotion
        and bowed to Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mademoiselle de Villefort is in deep sorrow, is she not?&rdquo;
        said Debray to Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Extremely,&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;she looked so pale this
        morning, I scarcely knew her.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        These apparently simple words pierced Morrel to the heart. This man had seen
        Valentine, and spoken to her! The young and high-spirited officer required all his
        strength of mind to resist breaking his oath. He took the arm of Château-Renaud,
        and turned towards the vault, where the attendants had already placed the two
        coffins.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This is a magnificent habitation,&rdquo; said Beauchamp, looking towards
        the mausoleum; &ldquo;a summer and winter palace. You will, in turn, enter it, my
        dear d&rsquo;Épinay, for you will soon be numbered as one of the family. I, as a
        philosopher, should like a little country-house, a cottage down there under the
        trees, without so many free-stones over my poor body. In dying, I will say to
        those around me what Voltaire wrote to Piron: &lsquo;<i>Eo rus</i>, and all will
        be over.&rsquo; But come, Franz, take courage, your wife is an heiress.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed, Beauchamp, you are unbearable. Politics has made you laugh
        at everything, and political men have made you disbelieve everything. But
        when you have the honor of associating with ordinary men, and the pleasure
        of leaving politics for a moment, try to find your affectionate heart,
        which you leave with your stick when you go to the Chamber.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But tell me,&rdquo; said Beauchamp, &ldquo;what is life? Is it not
        a halt in Death&rsquo;s anteroom?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40026m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am prejudiced against Beauchamp,&rdquo; said Albert, drawing
        Franz away, and leaving the former to finish his philosophical
        dissertation with Debray.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Villefort vault formed a square of white stones, about twenty feet high; an
        interior partition separated the two families, and each apartment had its entrance
        door. Here were not, as in other tombs, ignoble drawers, one above another, where
        thrift bestows its dead and labels them like specimens in a museum; all that was
        visible within the bronze gates was a gloomy-looking room, separated by a wall
        from the vault itself. The two doors before mentioned were in the middle
        of this wall, and enclosed the Villefort and Saint-Méran coffins. There
        grief might freely expend itself without being disturbed by the trifling
        loungers who came from a picnic party to visit Père-Lachaise, or by lovers
        who make it their rendezvous.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two coffins were placed on trestles previously prepared for their
        reception in the right-hand crypt belonging to the Saint-Méran family.
        Villefort, Franz, and a few near relatives alone entered the sanctuary.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the religious ceremonies had all been performed at the door, and there
        was no address given, the party all separated; Château-Renaud, Albert, and
        Morrel, went one way, and Debray and Beauchamp the other. Franz remained
        with M. de Villefort; at the gate of the cemetery Morrel made an excuse
        to wait; he saw Franz and M. de Villefort get into the same mourning-coach,
        and thought this meeting forboded evil. He then returned to Paris,
        and although in the same carriage with Château-Renaud and Albert, he did
        not hear one word of their conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Franz was about to take leave of M. de Villefort, &ldquo;When shall I see
        you again?&rdquo; said the latter.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At what time you please, sir,&rdquo; replied Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As soon as possible.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am at your command, sir; shall we return together?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If not unpleasant to you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On the contrary, I shall feel much pleasure.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, the future father and son-in-law stepped into the same carriage, and Morrel,
        seeing them pass, became uneasy. Villefort and Franz returned to the
        Faubourg Saint-Honoré. The procureur, without going to see either his wife
        or his daughter, went at once to his study, and, offering the young man a
        chair:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Épinay,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;allow me to remind you at this
        moment,&mdash;which is perhaps not so ill-chosen as at first sight may appear, for
        obedience to the wishes of the departed is the first offering which should be made
        at their tomb,&mdash;allow me then to remind you of the wish expressed by Madame
        de Saint-Méran on her death-bed, that Valentine&rsquo;s wedding might not be
        deferred. You know the affairs of the deceased are in perfect order, and her will
        bequeaths to Valentine the entire property of the Saint-Méran family; the notary
        showed me the documents yesterday, which will enable us to draw up the
        contract immediately. You may call on the notary, M. Deschamps, Place
        Beauveau, Faubourg Saint-Honoré, and you have my authority to inspect
        those deeds.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied M. d&rsquo;Épinay, &ldquo;it is not, perhaps,
        the moment for Mademoiselle Valentine, who is in deep distress, to think
        of a husband; indeed, I fear&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40028m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Valentine will have no greater pleasure than that of fulfilling her
        grandmother&rsquo;s last injunctions; there will be no obstacle from that
        quarter, I assure you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; replied Franz, &ldquo;as I shall raise none,
        you may make arrangements when you please; I have pledged my word, and
        shall feel pleasure and happiness in adhering to it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Villefort, &ldquo;nothing further is required.
        The contract was to have been signed three days since; we shall find it
        all ready, and can sign it today.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But the mourning?&rdquo; said Franz, hesitating.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be uneasy on that score,&rdquo; replied Villefort;
        &ldquo;no ceremony will be neglected in my house. Mademoiselle de
        Villefort may retire during the prescribed three months to her estate of
        Saint-Méran; I say hers, for she inherits it today. There, after a few
        days, if you like, the civil marriage shall be celebrated without pomp or
        ceremony. Madame de Saint-Méran wished her daughter should be married
        there. When that is over, you, sir, can return to Paris, while your wife
        passes the time of her mourning with her mother-in-law.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As you please, sir,&rdquo; said Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; replied M. de Villefort, &ldquo;have the kindness to
        wait half an hour; Valentine shall come down into the drawing-room. I will
        send for M. Deschamps; we will read and sign the contract before we
        separate, and this evening Madame de Villefort shall accompany Valentine
        to her estate, where we will rejoin them in a week.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Franz, &ldquo;I have one request to make.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I wish Albert de Morcerf and Raoul de Château-Renaud to be present
        at this signature; you know they are my witnesses.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Half an hour will suffice to apprise them; will you go for them
        yourself, or shall you send?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I prefer going, sir.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall expect you, then, in half an hour, baron, and Valentine
        will be ready.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz bowed and left the room. Scarcely had the door closed, when M. de Villefort
        sent to tell Valentine to be ready in the drawing-room in half an hour, as he
        expected the notary and M. d&rsquo;Épinay and his witnesses. The news caused a
        great sensation throughout the house; Madame de Villefort would not believe it,
        and Valentine was thunderstruck. She looked around for help, and would have gone
        down to her grandfather&rsquo;s room, but on the stairs she met M. de Villefort,
        who took her arm and led her into the drawing-room. In the anteroom, Valentine
        met Barrois, and looked despairingly at the old servant. A moment later, Madame
        de Villefort entered the drawing-room with her little Edward. It was evident
        that she had shared the grief of the family, for she was pale and looked
        fatigued. She sat down, took Edward on her knees, and from time to time
        pressed this child, on whom her affections appeared centred, almost
        convulsively to her bosom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two carriages were soon heard to enter the courtyard. One was the notary&rsquo;s;
        the other, that of Franz and his friends. In a moment the whole party was
        assembled. Valentine was so pale one might trace the blue veins from her
        temples, round her eyes and down her cheeks. Franz was deeply affected.
        Château-Renaud and Albert looked at each other with amazement; the
        ceremony which was just concluded had not appeared more sorrowful than did
        that which was about to begin. Madame de Villefort had placed herself in
        the shadow behind a velvet curtain, and as she constantly bent over her
        child, it was difficult to read the expression of her face. M. de
        Villefort was, as usual, unmoved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The notary, after having, according to the customary method, arranged the
        papers on the table, taken his place in an armchair, and raised his
        spectacles, turned towards Franz:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you M. Franz de Quesnel, baron d&rsquo;Épinay?&rdquo; asked he,
        although he knew it perfectly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied Franz. The notary bowed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have, then, to inform you, sir, at the request of M. de
        Villefort, that your projected marriage with Mademoiselle de Villefort has
        changed the feeling of M. Noirtier towards his grandchild, and that he
        disinherits her entirely of the fortune he would have left her. Let me
        hasten to add,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;that the testator, having only
        the right to alienate a part of his fortune, and having alienated it all,
        the will will not bear scrutiny, and is declared null and void.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; said Villefort; &ldquo;but I warn M. d&rsquo;Épinay,
        that during my life-time my father&rsquo;s will shall never be questioned,
        my position forbidding any doubt to be entertained.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40032m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Franz, &ldquo;I regret much that such a question
        has been raised in the presence of Mademoiselle Valentine; I have never
        inquired the amount of her fortune, which, however limited it may be,
        exceeds mine. My family has sought consideration in this alliance with M.
        de Villefort; all I seek is happiness.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine imperceptibly thanked him, while two silent tears rolled down her cheeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Besides, sir,&rdquo; said Villefort, addressing himself to his future
        son-in-law, &ldquo;excepting the loss of a portion of your hopes, this unexpected
        will need not personally wound you; M. Noirtier&rsquo;s weakness of mind
        sufficiently explains it. It is not because Mademoiselle Valentine is
        going to marry you that he is angry, but because she will marry, a union
        with any other would have caused him the same sorrow. Old age is selfish,
        sir, and Mademoiselle de Villefort has been a faithful companion to M.
        Noirtier, which she cannot be when she becomes the Baroness d&rsquo;Épinay.
        My father&rsquo;s melancholy state prevents our speaking to him on any
        subjects, which the weakness of his mind would incapacitate him from
        understanding, and I am perfectly convinced that at the present time,
        although, he knows that his granddaughter is going to be married, M.
        Noirtier has even forgotten the name of his intended grandson.&rdquo; M.
        de Villefort had scarcely said this, when the door opened, and Barrois
        appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, in a tone strangely firm for a servant
        speaking to his masters under such solemn circumstances,&mdash;&ldquo;gentlemen,
        M. Noirtier de Villefort wishes to speak immediately to M. Franz de
        Quesnel, baron d&rsquo;Épinay.&rdquo; He, as well as the notary, that
        there might be no mistake in the person, gave all his titles to the
        bridegroom elect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort started, Madame de Villefort let her son slip from her knees,
        Valentine rose, pale and dumb as a statue. Albert and Château-Renaud
        exchanged a second look, more full of amazement than the first. The notary
        looked at Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is impossible,&rdquo; said the procureur. &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Épinay
        cannot leave the drawing-room at present.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is at this moment,&rdquo; replied Barrois with the same
        firmness, &ldquo;that M. Noirtier, my master, wishes to speak on important
        subjects to M. Franz d&rsquo;Épinay.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Grandpapa Noirtier can speak now, then,&rdquo; said Edward, with
        his habitual quickness. However, his remark did not make Madame de
        Villefort even smile, so much was every mind engaged, and so solemn was
        the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Tell M. Nortier,&rdquo; resumed Villefort, &ldquo;that what he demands is
        impossible.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then, M. Nortier gives notice to these gentlemen,&rdquo; replied Barrois,
        &ldquo;that he will give orders to be carried to the drawing-room.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Astonishment was at its height. Something like a smile was perceptible on Madame
        de Villefort&rsquo;s countenance. Valentine instinctively raised her eyes, as
        if to thank heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Pray go, Valentine,&rdquo; said; M. de Villefort, &ldquo;and see
        what this new fancy of your grandfather&rsquo;s is.&rdquo; Valentine rose
        quickly, and was hastening joyfully towards the door, when M. de Villefort
        altered his intention.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I will go with you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Excuse me, sir,&rdquo; said Franz, &ldquo;since M. Noirtier sent
        for me, I am ready to attend to his wish; besides, I shall be happy to pay
        my respects to him, not having yet had the honor of doing so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Pray, sir,&rdquo; said Villefort with marked uneasiness, &ldquo;do
        not disturb yourself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40034m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Forgive me, sir,&rdquo; said Franz in a resolute tone. &ldquo;I
        would not lose this opportunity of proving to M. Noirtier how wrong it
        would be of him to encourage feelings of dislike to me, which I am
        determined to conquer, whatever they may be, by my devotion.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And without listening to Villefort he arose, and followed Valentine, who was
        running downstairs with the joy of a shipwrecked mariner who finds a rock
        to cling to. M. de Villefort followed them. Château-Renaud and Morcerf
        exchanged a third look of still increasing wonder.
