      <h2>Chapter 83. The Hand of God</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>aderousse
        continued to call piteously, &ldquo;Help, reverend sir, help!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Help,&rdquo; cried Caderousse; &ldquo;I am murdered!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We are here;&mdash;take courage.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s all over! You are come too late&mdash;you are come
        to see me die. What blows, what blood!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He fainted. Ali and his master conveyed the wounded man into a room. Monte Cristo
        motioned to Ali to undress him, and he then examined his dreadful wounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;thy vengeance is sometimes delayed, but
        only that it may fall the more effectually.&rdquo; Ali looked at his master for
        further instructions. &ldquo;Bring here immediately the king&rsquo;s attorney, M.
        de Villefort, who lives in the Faubourg Saint-Honoré. As you pass the
        lodge, wake the porter, and send him for a surgeon.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Ali obeyed, leaving the abbé alone with Caderousse, who had not yet revived.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the wretched man again opened his eyes, the count looked at him with
        a mournful expression of pity, and his lips moved as if in prayer. &ldquo;A
        surgeon, reverend sir&mdash;a surgeon!&rdquo; said Caderousse.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have sent for one,&rdquo; replied the abbé.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I know he cannot save my life, but he may strengthen me to give my
        evidence.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Against whom?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Against my murderer.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you recognize him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; it was Benedetto.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The young Corsican?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Himself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your comrade?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes. After giving me the plan of this house, doubtless hoping I
        should kill the count and he thus become his heir, or that the count would
        kill me and I should be out of his way, he waylaid me, and has murdered
        me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have also sent for the procureur.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He will not come in time; I feel my life fast ebbing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo. He left the room, and
        returned in five minutes with a phial. The dying man&rsquo;s eyes were all
        the time riveted on the door, through which he hoped succor would arrive.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Hasten, reverend sir, hasten! I shall faint again!&rdquo; Monte
        Cristo approached, and dropped on his purple lips three or four drops of
        the contents of the phial. Caderousse drew a deep breath. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo;
        said he, &ldquo;that is life to me; more, more!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Two drops more would kill you,&rdquo; replied the abbé.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, send for someone to whom I can denounce the wretch!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall I write your deposition? You can sign it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Caderousse; and his eyes glistened at the
        thought of this posthumous revenge. Monte Cristo wrote:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I die, murdered by the Corsican Benedetto, my comrade in the
        galleys at Toulon, No. 59.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Quick, quick!&rdquo; said Caderousse, &ldquo;or I shall be unable
        to sign it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo gave the pen to Caderousse, who collected all his strength,
        signed it, and fell back on his bed, saying:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You will relate all the rest, reverend sir; you will say he calls himself
        Andrea Cavalcanti. He lodges at the Hôtel des Princes. Oh, I am dying!&rdquo;
        He again fainted. The abbé made him smell the contents of the phial, and he again
        opened his eyes. His desire for revenge had not forsaken him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, you will tell all I have said, will you not, reverend sir?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, and much more.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What more will you say?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house, in
        the hope the count would kill you. I will say, likewise, he had apprised
        the count, by a note, of your intention, and, the count being absent, I
        read the note and sat up to await you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And he will be guillotined, will be not?&rdquo; said Caderousse.
        &ldquo;Promise me that, and I will die with that hope.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will say,&rdquo; continued the count, &ldquo;that he followed and
        watched you the whole time, and when he saw you leave the house, ran to
        the angle of the wall to conceal himself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you see all that?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Remember my words: &lsquo;If you return home safely, I shall
        believe God has forgiven you, and I will forgive you also.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you did not warn me!&rdquo; cried Caderousse, raising himself
        on his elbows. &ldquo;You knew I should be killed on leaving this house,
        and did not warn me!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40168m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; for I saw God&rsquo;s justice placed in the hands of Benedetto,
        and should have thought it sacrilege to oppose the designs of Providence.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;God&rsquo;s justice! Speak not of it, reverend sir. If God were
        just, you know how many would be punished who now escape.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Patience,&rdquo; said the abbé, in a tone which made the dying man
        shudder; &ldquo;have patience!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Caderousse looked at him with amazement.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said the abbé, &ldquo;God is merciful to all, as he has
        been to you; he is first a father, then a judge.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you then believe in God?&rdquo; said Caderousse.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Had I been so unhappy as not to believe in him until now,&rdquo;
        said Monte Cristo, &ldquo;I must believe on seeing you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Caderousse raised his clenched hands towards heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said the abbé, extending his hand over the wounded
        man, as if to command him to believe; &ldquo;this is what the God in whom,
        on your death-bed, you refuse to believe, has done for you&mdash;he gave
        you health, strength, regular employment, even friends&mdash;a life, in
        fact, which a man might enjoy with a calm conscience. Instead of improving
        these gifts, rarely granted so abundantly, this has been your course&mdash;you
        have given yourself up to sloth and drunkenness, and in a fit of
        intoxication have ruined your best friend.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; cried Caderousse; &ldquo;I require a surgeon, not a
        priest; perhaps I am not mortally wounded&mdash;I may not die; perhaps
        they can yet save my life.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your wounds are so far mortal that, without the three drops I gave
        you, you would now be dead. Listen, then.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; murmured Caderousse, &ldquo;what a strange priest you
        are; you drive the dying to despair, instead of consoling them.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; continued the abbé. &ldquo;When you had betrayed
        your friend, God began not to strike, but to warn you. Poverty overtook
        you. You had already passed half your life in coveting that which you
        might have honorably acquired; and already you contemplated crime under
        the excuse of want, when God worked a miracle in your behalf, sending you,
        by my hands, a fortune&mdash;brilliant, indeed, for you, who had never
        possessed any. But this unexpected, unhoped-for, unheard-of fortune
        sufficed you no longer when you once possessed it; you wished to double
        it, and how?&mdash;by a murder! You succeeded, and then God snatched it
        from you, and brought you to justice.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It was not I who wished to kill the Jew,&rdquo; said Caderousse;
        &ldquo;it was La Carconte.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, &ldquo;and God,&mdash;I cannot say
        in justice, for his justice would have slain you,&mdash;but God, in his
        mercy, spared your life.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Pardieu!</i> to transport me for life, how merciful!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You thought it a mercy then, miserable wretch! The coward who
        feared death rejoiced at perpetual disgrace; for like all galley-slaves,
        you said, &lsquo;I may escape from prison, I cannot from the grave.&rsquo;
        And you said truly; the way was opened for you unexpectedly. An Englishman
        visited Toulon, who had vowed to rescue two men from infamy, and his
        choice fell on you and your companion. You received a second fortune,
        money and tranquillity were restored to you, and you, who had been
        condemned to a felon&rsquo;s life, might live as other men. Then, wretched
        creature, then you tempted God a third time. &lsquo;I have not enough,&rsquo;
        you said, when you had more than you before possessed, and you committed a
        third crime, without reason, without excuse. God is wearied; he has
        punished you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Caderousse was fast sinking. &ldquo;Give me drink,&rdquo; said he: &ldquo;I
        thirst&mdash;I burn!&rdquo; Monte Cristo gave him a glass of water.
        &ldquo;And yet that villain, Benedetto, will escape!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No one, I tell you, will escape; Benedetto will be punished.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then, you, too, will be punished, for you did not do your duty as a
        priest&mdash;you should have prevented Benedetto from killing me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I?&rdquo; said the count, with a smile which petrified the dying
        man, &ldquo;when you had just broken your knife against the coat of mail
        which protected my breast! Yet perhaps if I had found you humble and
        penitent, I might have prevented Benedetto from killing you; but I found
        you proud and blood-thirsty, and I left you in the hands of God.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not believe there is a God,&rdquo; howled Caderousse; &ldquo;you
        do not believe it; you lie&mdash;you lie!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Silence,&rdquo; said the abbé; &ldquo;you will force the last drop
        of blood from your veins. What! you do not believe in God when he is
        striking you dead? you will not believe in him, who requires but a prayer,
        a word, a tear, and he will forgive? God, who might have directed the
        assassin&rsquo;s dagger so as to end your career in a moment, has given
        you this quarter of an hour for repentance. Reflect, then, wretched man,
        and repent.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Caderousse, &ldquo;no; I will not repent. There is
        no God; there is no Providence&mdash;all comes by chance.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There is a Providence; there is a God,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo,
        &ldquo;of whom you are a striking proof, as you lie in utter despair,
        denying him, while I stand before you, rich, happy, safe and entreating
        that God in whom you endeavor not to believe, while in your heart you
        still believe in him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But who are you, then?&rdquo; asked Caderousse, fixing his dying
        eyes on the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Look well at me!&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, putting the light near his face.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, the abbé&mdash;the Abbé Busoni.&rdquo; Monte Cristo took off the wig
        which disfigured him, and let fall his black hair, which added so much to the
        beauty of his pallid features.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh?&rdquo; said Caderousse, thunderstruck, &ldquo;but for that black hair,
        I should say you were the Englishman, Lord Wilmore.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am neither the Abbé Busoni nor Lord Wilmore,&rdquo; said Monte
        Cristo; &ldquo;think again,&mdash;do you not recollect me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a magic effect in the count&rsquo;s words, which once more revived the
        exhausted powers of the miserable man.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I think I have seen you and known
        you formerly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, Caderousse, you have seen me; you knew me once.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Who, then, are you? and why, if you knew me, do you let me die?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because nothing can save you; your wounds are mortal. Had it been
        possible to save you, I should have considered it another proof of God&rsquo;s
        mercy, and I would again have endeavored to restore you, I swear by my
        father&rsquo;s tomb.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By your father&rsquo;s tomb!&rdquo; said Caderousse, supported by a
        supernatural power, and half-raising himself to see more distinctly the
        man who had just taken the oath which all men hold sacred; &ldquo;who,
        then, are you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The count had watched the approach of death. He knew this was the last struggle.
        He approached the dying man, and, leaning over him with a calm and melancholy
        look, he whispered, &ldquo;I am&mdash;I am&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And his almost closed lips uttered a name so low that the count himself
        appeared afraid to hear it. Caderousse, who had raised himself on his
        knees, and stretched out his arm, tried to draw back, then clasping his
        hands, and raising them with a desperate effort, &ldquo;Oh, my God, my God!&rdquo;
        said he, &ldquo;pardon me for having denied thee; thou dost exist, thou
        art indeed man&rsquo;s father in heaven, and his judge on earth. My God, my Lord,
        I have long despised thee! Pardon me, my God; receive me, Oh, my Lord!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Caderousse sighed deeply, and fell back with a groan. The blood no longer flowed
        from his wounds. He was dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>One!</i>&rdquo; said the count mysteriously, his eyes fixed on
        the corpse, disfigured by so awful a death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ten minutes afterwards the surgeon and the procureur arrived, the one accompanied
        by the porter, the other by Ali, and were received by the Abbé Busoni, who was
        praying by the side of the corpse.
