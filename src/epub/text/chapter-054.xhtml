      <h2>Chapter 54. A Flurry in Stocks</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ome days after
        this meeting, Albert de Morcerf visited the Count of Monte Cristo at his
        house in the Champs-Élysées, which had already assumed that palace-like
        appearance which the count&rsquo;s princely fortune enabled him to give
        even to his most temporary residences. He came to renew the thanks of
        Madame Danglars which had been already conveyed to the count through the
        medium of a letter, signed &ldquo;Baronne Danglars, <i>née</i> Hermine de
        Servieux.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Albert was accompanied by Lucien Debray, who, joining in his friend&rsquo;s
        conversation, added some passing compliments, the source of which the
        count&rsquo;s talent for finesse easily enabled him to guess. He was
        convinced that Lucien&rsquo;s visit was due to a double feeling of
        curiosity, the larger half of which sentiment emanated from the Rue de la
        Chaussée d&rsquo;Antin. In short, Madame Danglars, not being able
        personally to examine in detail the domestic economy and household
        arrangements of a man who gave away horses worth 30,000 francs and who
        went to the opera with a Greek slave wearing diamonds to the amount of a
        million of money, had deputed those eyes, by which she was accustomed to
        see, to give her a faithful account of the mode of life of this
        incomprehensible person. But the count did not appear to suspect that
        there could be the slightest connection between Lucien&rsquo;s visit and
        the curiosity of the baroness.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are in constant communication with the Baron Danglars?&rdquo;
        the count inquired of Albert de Morcerf.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, count, you know what I told you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;All remains the same, then, in that quarter?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is more than ever a settled thing,&rdquo; said Lucien,&mdash;and,
        considering that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon
        to make, he adjusted the glass to his eye, and biting the top of his gold
        headed cane, began to make the tour of the apartment, examining the arms
        and the pictures.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo &ldquo;I did not expect that the
        affair would be so promptly concluded.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, things take their course without our assistance. While we are
        forgetting them, they are falling into their appointed order; and when,
        again, our attention is directed to them, we are surprised at the progress
        they have made towards the proposed end. My father and M. Danglars served
        together in Spain, my father in the army and M. Danglars in the
        commissariat department. It was there that my father, ruined by the
        revolution, and M. Danglars, who never had possessed any patrimony, both
        laid the foundations of their different fortunes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo &ldquo;I think M. Danglars mentioned
        that in a visit which I paid him; and,&rdquo; continued he, casting a
        side-glance at Lucien, who was turning over the leaves of an album,
        &ldquo;Mademoiselle Eugénie is pretty&mdash;I think I remember that to be
        her name.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very pretty, or rather, very beautiful,&rdquo; replied Albert,
        &ldquo;but of that style of beauty which I do not appreciate; I am an
        ungrateful fellow.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You speak as if you were already her husband.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; returned Albert, in his turn looking around to see what
        Lucien was doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, lowering his voice, &ldquo;you do
        not appear to me to be very enthusiastic on the subject of this marriage.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mademoiselle Danglars is too rich for me,&rdquo; replied Morcerf,
        &ldquo;and that frightens me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bah,&rdquo; exclaimed Monte Cristo, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a fine
        reason to give. Are you not rich yourself?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My father&rsquo;s income is about 50,000 francs per annum; and he
        will give me, perhaps, ten or twelve thousand when I marry.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That, perhaps, might not be considered a large sum, in Paris
        especially,&rdquo; said the count; &ldquo;but everything does not depend
        on wealth, and it is a fine thing to have a good name, and to occupy a
        high station in society. Your name is celebrated, your position
        magnificent; and then the Comte de Morcerf is a soldier, and it is
        pleasing to see the integrity of a Bayard united to the poverty of a
        Duguesclin; disinterestedness is the brightest ray in which a noble sword
        can shine. As for me, I consider the union with Mademoiselle Danglars a
        most suitable one; she will enrich you, and you will ennoble her.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Albert shook his head, and looked thoughtful.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There is still something else,&rdquo; said he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; observed Monte Cristo, &ldquo;that I have some
        difficulty in comprehending your objection to a young lady who is both
        rich and beautiful.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Morcerf, &ldquo;this repugnance, if repugnance it
        may be called, is not all on my side.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Whence can it arise, then? for you told me your father desired the
        marriage.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is my mother who dissents; she has a clear and penetrating
        judgment, and does not smile on the proposed union. I cannot account for
        it, but she seems to entertain some prejudice against the Danglars.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30107m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the count, in a somewhat forced tone, &ldquo;that
        may be easily explained; the Comtesse de Morcerf, who is aristocracy and
        refinement itself, does not relish the idea of being allied by your
        marriage with one of ignoble birth; that is natural enough.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not know if that is her reason,&rdquo; said Albert, &ldquo;but
        one thing I do know, that if this marriage be consummated, it will render
        her quite miserable. There was to have been a meeting six weeks ago in
        order to talk over and settle the affair; but I had such a sudden attack
        of indisposition&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Real?&rdquo; interrupted the count, smiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, real enough, from anxiety doubtless,&mdash;at any rate they
        postponed the matter for two months. There is no hurry, you know. I am not
        yet twenty-one, and Eugénie is only seventeen; but the two months expire
        next week. It must be done. My dear count, you cannot imagine how my mind
        is harassed. How happy you are in being exempt from all this!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and why should not you be free, too? What prevents you from
        being so?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, it will be too great a disappointment to my father if I do not
        marry Mademoiselle Danglars.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Marry her then,&rdquo; said the count, with a significant shrug of
        the shoulders.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Morcerf, &ldquo;but that will plunge my mother
        into positive grief.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then do not marry her,&rdquo; said the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I shall see. I will try and think over what is the best thing
        to be done; you will give me your advice, will you not, and if possible
        extricate me from my unpleasant position? I think, rather than give pain
        to my dear mother, I would run the risk of offending the count.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo turned away; he seemed moved by this last remark.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he to Debray, who had thrown himself into an easy-chair at
        the farthest extremity of the salon, and who held a pencil in his right hand
        and an account book in his left, &ldquo;what are you doing there? Are you
        making a sketch after Poussin?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; was the tranquil response; &ldquo;I am too fond of
        art to attempt anything of that sort. I am doing a little sum in
        arithmetic.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In arithmetic?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; I am calculating&mdash;by the way, Morcerf, that indirectly
        concerns you&mdash;I am calculating what the house of Danglars must have
        gained by the last rise in Haiti bonds; from 206 they have risen to 409 in
        three days, and the prudent banker had purchased at 206; therefore he must
        have made 300,000 livres.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is not his biggest scoop,&rdquo; said Morcerf; &ldquo;did he
        not make a million in Spaniards this last year?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said Lucien, &ldquo;here is the Count of
        Monte Cristo, who will say to you, as the Italians do,&mdash;
      </p>
      <pre xml:space="preserve">
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Denaro e santità,
        Metà della metà.&rsquo;<a href="#linknote-9" name="linknoteref-9" id="linknoteref-9">9</a>
      </pre>
      <p>
        &ldquo;When they tell me such things, I only shrug my shoulders and say
        nothing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But you were speaking of Haitians?&rdquo; said Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, Haitians,&mdash;that is quite another thing! Haitians are the
        <i>écarté</i> of French stock-jobbing. We may like bouillotte, delight in
        whist, be enraptured with boston, and yet grow tired of them all; but we
        always come back to <i>écarté</i>&mdash;it is not only a game, it is a <i>hors-d&rsquo;œuvre</i>!
        M. Danglars sold yesterday at 405, and pockets 300,000 francs. Had he but
        waited till today, the price would have fallen to 205, and instead of
        gaining 300,000 francs, he would have lost 20 or 25,000.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what has caused the sudden fall from 409 to 206?&rdquo; asked
        Monte Cristo. &ldquo;I am profoundly ignorant of all these stock-jobbing
        intrigues.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Albert, laughing, &ldquo;one piece of news
        follows another, and there is often great dissimilarity between them.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;I see that M. Danglars is
        accustomed to play at gaining or losing 300,000 francs in a day; he must
        be enormously rich.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is not he who plays!&rdquo; exclaimed Lucien; &ldquo;it is
        Madame Danglars; she is indeed daring.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But you who are a reasonable being, Lucien, and who knows how
        little dependence is to be placed on the news, since you are at the
        fountain-head, surely you ought to prevent it,&rdquo; said Morcerf, with a
        smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How can I, if her husband fails in controlling her?&rdquo; asked
        Lucien; &ldquo;you know the character of the baroness&mdash;no one has any
        influence with her, and she does precisely what she pleases.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, if I were in your place&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Albert.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I would reform her; it would be rendering a service to her future
        son-in-law.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How would you set about it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, that would be easy enough&mdash;I would give her a lesson.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A lesson?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes. Your position as secretary to the minister renders your
        authority great on the subject of political news; you never open your
        mouth but the stockbrokers immediately stenograph your words. Cause her to
        lose a hundred thousand francs, and that would teach her prudence.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not understand,&rdquo; stammered Lucien.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is very clear, notwithstanding,&rdquo; replied the young man,
        with an artlessness wholly free from affectation; &ldquo;tell her some
        fine morning an unheard-of piece of intelligence&mdash;some telegraphic
        despatch, of which you alone are in possession; for instance, that Henri
        IV. was seen yesterday at Gabrielle&rsquo;s. That would boom the market;
        she will buy heavily, and she will certainly lose when Beauchamp announces
        the following day, in his gazette, &lsquo;The report circulated by some
        usually well-informed persons that the king was seen yesterday at
        Gabrielle&rsquo;s house, is totally without foundation. We can positively
        assert that his majesty did not quit the Pont-Neuf.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Lucien half smiled. Monte Cristo, although apparently indifferent, had not lost
        one word of this conversation, and his penetrating eye had even read a
        hidden secret in the embarrassed manner of the secretary. This
        embarrassment had completely escaped Albert, but it caused Lucien to
        shorten his visit; he was evidently ill at ease. The count, in taking
        leave of him, said something in a low voice, to which he answered, &ldquo;Willingly,
        count; I accept.&rdquo; The count returned to young Morcerf.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you not think, on reflection,&rdquo; said he to him, &ldquo;that
        you have done wrong in thus speaking of your mother-in-law in the presence
        of M. Debray?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear count,&rdquo; said Morcerf, &ldquo;I beg of you not to
        apply that title so prematurely.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now, speaking without any exaggeration, is your mother really so
        very much averse to this marriage?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So much so that the baroness very rarely comes to the house, and my
        mother, has not, I think, visited Madame Danglars twice in her whole life.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;I am emboldened to speak openly
        to you. M. Danglars is my banker; M. de Villefort has overwhelmed me with
        politeness in return for a service which a casual piece of good fortune
        enabled me to render him. I predict from all this an avalanche of dinners
        and routs. Now, in order not to presume on this, and also to be beforehand
        with them, I have, if agreeable to you, thought of inviting M. and Madame
        Danglars, and M. and Madame de Villefort, to my country-house at Auteuil.
        If I were to invite you and the Count and Countess of Morcerf to this
        dinner, I should give it the appearance of being a matrimonial meeting, or
        at least Madame de Morcerf would look upon the affair in that light,
        especially if Baron Danglars did me the honor to bring his daughter. In
        that case your mother would hold me in aversion, and I do not at all wish
        that; on the contrary, I desire to stand high in her esteem.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed, count,&rdquo; said Morcerf, &ldquo;I thank you sincerely
        for having used so much candor towards me, and I gratefully accept the
        exclusion which you propose. You say you desire my mother&rsquo;s good
        opinion; I assure you it is already yours to a very unusual extent.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30111m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, with interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I am sure of it; we talked of you an hour after you left us the
        other day. But to return to what we were saying. If my mother could know
        of this attention on your part&mdash;and I will venture to tell her&mdash;I
        am sure that she will be most grateful to you; it is true that my father
        will be equally angry.&rdquo; The count laughed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he to Morcerf, &ldquo;but I think your father will not be
        the only angry one; M. and Madame Danglars will think me a very ill-mannered
        person. They know that I am intimate with you&mdash;that you are, in fact; one of
        the oldest of my Parisian acquaintances&mdash;and they will not find you at my
        house; they will certainly ask me why I did not invite you. Be sure to
        provide yourself with some previous engagement which shall have a
        semblance of probability, and communicate the fact to me by a line in
        writing. You know that with bankers nothing but a written document will be
        valid.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will do better than that,&rdquo; said Albert; &ldquo;my mother is
        wishing to go to the sea-side&mdash;what day is fixed for your dinner?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Saturday.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This is Tuesday&mdash;well, tomorrow evening we leave, and the day
        after we shall be at Tréport. Really, count, you have a delightful way of
        setting people at their ease.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed, you give me more credit than I deserve; I only wish to do
        what will be agreeable to you, that is all.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;When shall you send your invitations?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This very day.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I will immediately call on M. Danglars, and tell him that my
        mother and myself must leave Paris tomorrow. I have not seen you,
        consequently I know nothing of your dinner.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How foolish you are! Have you forgotten that M. Debray has just
        seen you at my house?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, true.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Fix it this way. I have seen you, and invited you without any
        ceremony, when you instantly answered that it would be impossible for you
        to accept, as you were going to Tréport.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, that is settled; but you will come and call on my
        mother before tomorrow?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Before tomorrow?&mdash;that will be a difficult matter to arrange,
        besides, I shall just be in the way of all the preparations for departure.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, you can do better. You were only a charming man before, but,
        if you accede to my proposal, you will be adorable.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What must I do to attain such sublimity?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are today free as air&mdash;come and dine with me; we shall be
        a small party&mdash;only yourself, my mother, and I. You have scarcely
        seen my mother; you shall have an opportunity of observing her more
        closely. She is a remarkable woman, and I only regret that there does not
        exist another like her, about twenty years younger; in that case, I assure
        you, there would very soon be a Countess and Viscountess of Morcerf. As to
        my father, you will not see him; he is officially engaged, and dines with
        the chief referendary. We will talk over our travels; and you, who have
        seen the whole world, will relate your adventures&mdash;you shall tell us
        the history of the beautiful Greek who was with you the other night at the
        Opera, and whom you call your slave, and yet treat like a princess. We
        will talk Italian and Spanish. Come, accept my invitation, and my mother
        will thank you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A thousand thanks,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;your invitation is
        most gracious, and I regret exceedingly that it is not in my power to
        accept it. I am not so much at liberty as you suppose; on the contrary, I
        have a most important engagement.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, take care, you were teaching me just now how, in case of an
        invitation to dinner, one might creditably make an excuse. I require the
        proof of a pre-engagement. I am not a banker, like M. Danglars, but I am
        quite as incredulous as he is.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am going to give you a proof,&rdquo; replied the count, and he
        rang the bell.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; said Morcerf, &ldquo;this is the second time you have
        refused to dine with my mother; it is evident that you wish to avoid her.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo started. &ldquo;Oh, you do not mean that,&rdquo; said he;
        &ldquo;besides, here comes the confirmation of my assertion.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Baptistin entered, and remained standing at the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I had no previous knowledge of your visit, had I?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed, you are such an extraordinary person, that I would not
        answer for it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At all events, I could not guess that you would invite me to
        dinner.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Probably not.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, listen, Baptistin, what did I tell you this morning when I
        called you into my laboratory?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To close the door against visitors as soon as the clock struck
        five,&rdquo; replied the valet.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What then?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, my dear count,&rdquo; said Albert.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no, I wish to do away with that mysterious reputation that you
        have given me, my dear viscount; it is tiresome to be always acting
        Manfred. I wish my life to be free and open. Go on, Baptistin.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then to admit no one except Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti and his
        son.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You hear&mdash;Major Bartolomeo Cavalcanti&mdash;a man who ranks
        amongst the most ancient nobility of Italy, whose name Dante has
        celebrated in the tenth canto of <i>The Inferno</i>, you remember it, do
        you not? Then there is his son, Andrea, a charming young man, about your
        own age, viscount, bearing the same title as yourself, and who is making
        his entry into the Parisian world, aided by his father&rsquo;s millions.
        The major will bring his son with him this evening, the <i>contino</i>, as
        we say in Italy; he confides him to my care. If he proves himself worthy
        of it, I will do what I can to advance his interests. You will assist me
        in the work, will you not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Most undoubtedly. This Major Cavalcanti is an old friend of yours,
        then?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By no means. He is a perfect nobleman, very polite, modest, and
        agreeable, such as may be found constantly in Italy, descendants of very
        ancient families. I have met him several times at Florence, Bologna and
        Lucca, and he has now communicated to me the fact of his arrival in Paris.
        The acquaintances one makes in travelling have a sort of claim on one;
        they everywhere expect to receive the same attention which you once paid
        them by chance, as though the civilities of a passing hour were likely to
        awaken any lasting interest in favor of the man in whose society you may
        happen to be thrown in the course of your journey. This good Major
        Cavalcanti is come to take a second view of Paris, which he only saw in
        passing through in the time of the Empire, when he was on his way to
        Moscow. I shall give him a good dinner, he will confide his son to my
        care, I will promise to watch over him, I shall let him follow in whatever
        path his folly may lead him, and then I shall have done my part.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly; I see you are a model Mentor,&rdquo; said Albert &ldquo;Good-bye,
        we shall return on Sunday. By the way, I have received news of Franz.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you? Is he still amusing himself in Italy?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I believe so; however, he regrets your absence extremely. He says
        you were the sun of Rome, and that without you all appears dark and
        cloudy; I do not know if he does not even go so far as to say that it
        rains.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;His opinion of me is altered for the better, then?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, he still persists in looking upon you as the most
        incomprehensible and mysterious of beings.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is a charming young man,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo &ldquo;and I
        felt a lively interest in him the very first evening of my introduction,
        when I met him in search of a supper, and prevailed upon him to accept a
        portion of mine. He is, I think, the son of General d&rsquo;Épinay?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The same who was so shamefully assassinated in 1815?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By the Bonapartists.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes. Really I like him extremely; is there not also a matrimonial
        engagement contemplated for him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, he is to marry Mademoiselle de Villefort.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30115m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you know I am to marry Mademoiselle Danglars,&rdquo; said
        Albert, laughing.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You smile.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why do you do so?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I smile because there appears to me to be about as much inclination
        for the consummation of the engagement in question as there is for my own.
        But really, my dear count, we are talking as much of women as they do of
        us; it is unpardonable.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Albert rose.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you going?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Really, that is a good idea!&mdash;two hours have I been boring you
        to death with my company, and then you, with the greatest politeness, ask
        me if I am going. Indeed, count, you are the most polished man in the
        world. And your servants, too, how very well behaved they are; there is
        quite a style about them. Monsieur Baptistin especially; I could never get
        such a man as that. My servants seem to imitate those you sometimes see in
        a play, who, because they have only a word or two to say, aquit themselves
        in the most awkward manner possible. Therefore, if you part with M.
        Baptistin, give me the refusal of him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By all means.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is not all; give my compliments to your illustrious Luccanese,
        Cavalcante of the Cavalcanti; and if by any chance he should be wishing to
        establish his son, find him a wife very rich, very noble on her mother&rsquo;s
        side at least, and a baroness in right of her father, I will help you in
        the search.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, ha; you will do as much as that, will you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, really, nothing is certain in this world.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, count, what a service you might render me! I should like you a
        hundred times better if, by your intervention, I could manage to remain a
        bachelor, even were it only for ten years.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing is impossible,&rdquo; gravely replied Monte Cristo; and
        taking leave of Albert, he returned into the house, and struck the gong
        three times. Bertuccio appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Monsieur Bertuccio, you understand that I intend entertaining company on
        Saturday at Auteuil.&rdquo; Bertuccio slightly started. &ldquo;I shall require your
        services to see that all be properly arranged. It is a beautiful house, or at all
        events may be made so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There must be a good deal done before it can deserve that title,
        your excellency, for the tapestried hangings are very old.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let them all be taken away and changed, then, with the exception of
        the sleeping-chamber which is hung with red damask; you will leave that
        exactly as it is.&rdquo; Bertuccio bowed. &ldquo;You will not touch the
        garden either; as to the yard, you may do what you please with it; I
        should prefer that being altered beyond all recognition.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will do everything in my power to carry out your wishes, your
        excellency. I should be glad, however, to receive your excellency&rsquo;s
        commands concerning the dinner.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Really, my dear M. Bertuccio,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;since
        you have been in Paris, you have become quite nervous, and apparently out
        of your element; you no longer seem to understand me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But surely your excellency will be so good as to inform me whom you
        are expecting to receive?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not yet know myself, neither is it necessary that you should
        do so. &lsquo;Lucullus dines with Lucullus,&rsquo; that is quite
        sufficient.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Bertuccio bowed, and left the room.
