      <h2>Chapter 103. Maximilian</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">V</span>illefort rose,
        half-ashamed of being surprised in such a paroxysm of grief. The terrible
        office he had held for twenty-five years had succeeded in making him more
        or less than man. His glance, at first wandering, fixed itself upon
        Morrel. &ldquo;Who are you, sir,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;that forget that
        this is not the manner to enter a house stricken with death? Go, sir, go!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        But Morrel remained motionless; he could not detach his eyes from that
        disordered bed, and the pale corpse of the young girl who was lying on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Go!&mdash;do you hear?&rdquo; said Villefort, while d&rsquo;Avrigny
        advanced to lead Morrel out. Maximilian stared for a moment at the corpse,
        gazed all around the room, then upon the two men; he opened his mouth to
        speak, but finding it impossible to give utterance to the innumerable
        ideas that occupied his brain, he went out, thrusting his hands through
        his hair in such a manner that Villefort and d&rsquo;Avrigny, for a moment
        diverted from the engrossing topic, exchanged glances, which seemed to
        say,&mdash;&ldquo;He is mad!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        But in less than five minutes the staircase groaned beneath an
        extraordinary weight. Morrel was seen carrying, with superhuman strength,
        the armchair containing Noirtier upstairs. When he reached the landing he
        placed the armchair on the floor and rapidly rolled it into Valentine&rsquo;s
        room. This could only have been accomplished by means of unnatural
        strength supplied by powerful excitement. But the most fearful spectacle
        was Noirtier being pushed towards the bed, his face expressing all his
        meaning, and his eyes supplying the want of every other faculty. That pale
        face and flaming glance appeared to Villefort like a frightful apparition.
        Each time he had been brought into contact with his father, something
        terrible had happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;See what they have done!&rdquo; cried Morrel, with one hand leaning on
        the back of the chair, and the other extended towards Valentine.
        &ldquo;See, my father, see!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort drew back and looked with astonishment on the young man, who,
        almost a stranger to him, called Noirtier his father. At this moment the
        whole soul of the old man seemed centred in his eyes which became
        bloodshot; the veins of the throat swelled; his cheeks and temples became
        purple, as though he was struck with epilepsy; nothing was wanting to
        complete this but the utterance of a cry. And the cry issued from his
        pores, if we may thus speak&mdash;a cry frightful in its silence. D&rsquo;Avrigny
        rushed towards the old man and made him inhale a powerful restorative.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; cried Morrel, seizing the moist hand of the paralytic,
        &ldquo;they ask me who I am, and what right I have to be here. Oh, you
        know it, tell them, tell them!&rdquo; And the young man&rsquo;s voice was
        choked by sobs.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the old man, his chest heaved with his panting respiration. One could
        have thought that he was undergoing the agonies preceding death. At length,
        happier than the young man, who sobbed without weeping, tears glistened in
        the eyes of Noirtier.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Tell them,&rdquo; said Morrel in a hoarse voice, &ldquo;tell them that I
        am her betrothed. Tell them she was my beloved, my noble girl, my only blessing
        in the world. Tell them&mdash;oh, tell them, that corpse belongs to me!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The young man overwhelmed by the weight of his anguish, fell heavily on
        his knees before the bed, which his fingers grasped with convulsive
        energy. D&rsquo;Avrigny, unable to bear the sight of this touching
        emotion, turned away; and Villefort, without seeking any further
        explanation, and attracted towards him by the irresistible magnetism which
        draws us towards those who have loved the people for whom we mourn,
        extended his hand towards the young man.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Morrel saw nothing; he had grasped the hand of Valentine, and unable to weep
        vented his agony in groans as he bit the sheets. For some time nothing was heard
        in that chamber but sobs, exclamations, and prayers. At length Villefort, the most
        composed of all, spoke:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he to Maximilian, &ldquo;you say you loved Valentine,
        that you were betrothed to her. I knew nothing of this engagement, of this love,
        yet I, her father, forgive you, for I see that your grief is real and deep;
        and besides my own sorrow is too great for anger to find a place in my heart.
        But you see that the angel whom you hoped for has left this earth&mdash;she has
        nothing more to do with the adoration of men. Take a last farewell, sir, of her
        sad remains; take the hand you expected to possess once more within your own,
        and then separate yourself from her forever. Valentine now requires only the
        ministrations of the priest.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50093m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are mistaken, sir,&rdquo; exclaimed Morrel, raising himself on
        one knee, his heart pierced by a more acute pang than any he had yet felt&mdash;&ldquo;you
        are mistaken; Valentine, dying as she has, not only requires a priest, but
        an avenger. <i>You</i>, M. de Villefort, send for the priest; <i>I</i>
        will be the avenger.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you mean, sir?&rdquo; asked Villefort, trembling at the new
        idea inspired by the delirium of Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I tell you, sir, that two persons exist in you; the father has
        mourned sufficiently, now let the procureur fulfil his office.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The eyes of Noirtier glistened, and d&rsquo;Avrigny approached.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Morrel, reading all that passed through the
        minds of the witnesses to the scene, &ldquo;I know what I am saying, and
        you know as well as I do what I am about to say&mdash;Valentine has been
        assassinated!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort hung his head, d&rsquo;Avrigny approached nearer, and Noirtier said
        &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; with his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now, sir,&rdquo; continued Morrel, &ldquo;in these days no one can
        disappear by violent means without some inquiries being made as to the cause of
        her disappearance, even were she not a young, beautiful, and adorable creature
        like Valentine. Now, M. le Procureur du Roi,&rdquo; said Morrel with increasing
        vehemence, &ldquo;no mercy is allowed; I denounce the crime; it is your place
        to seek the assassin.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The young man&rsquo;s implacable eyes interrogated Villefort, who, on his side,
        glanced from Noirtier to d&rsquo;Avrigny. But instead of finding sympathy in
        the eyes of the doctor and his father, he only saw an expression as inflexible
        as that of Maximilian.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; indicated the old man.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Assuredly,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Avrigny.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Villefort, striving to struggle against this
        triple force and his own emotion,&mdash;&ldquo;sir, you are deceived; no
        one commits crimes here. I am stricken by fate. It is horrible, indeed,
        but no one assassinates.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The eyes of Noirtier lighted up with rage, and d&rsquo;Avrigny prepared to
        speak. Morrel, however, extended his arm, and commanded silence.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And I say that murders <i>are</i> committed here,&rdquo; said Morrel,
        whose voice, though lower in tone, lost none of its terrible distinctness:
        &ldquo;I tell you that this is the fourth victim within the last four
        months. I tell you, Valentine&rsquo;s life was attempted by poison four
        days ago, though she escaped, owing to the precautions of M. Noirtier. I
        tell you that the dose has been double, the poison changed, and that this
        time it has succeeded. I tell you that you know these things as well as I
        do, since this gentleman has forewarned you, both as a doctor and as a
        friend.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, you rave, sir,&rdquo; exclaimed Villefort, in vain endeavoring
        to escape the net in which he was taken.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50095m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I rave?&rdquo; said Morrel; &ldquo;well, then, I appeal to M. d&rsquo;Avrigny
        himself. Ask him, sir, if he recollects the words he uttered in the garden
        of this house on the night of Madame de Saint-Méran&rsquo;s death. You
        thought yourselves alone, and talked about that tragical death, and the
        fatality you mentioned then is the same which has caused the murder of
        Valentine.&rdquo; Villefort and d&rsquo;Avrigny exchanged looks.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; continued Morrel; &ldquo;recall the scene, for the
        words you thought were only given to silence and solitude fell into my ears.
        Certainly, after witnessing the culpable indolence manifested by M. de
        Villefort towards his own relations, I ought to have denounced him to the
        authorities; then I should not have been an accomplice to thy death, as I
        now am, sweet, beloved Valentine; but the accomplice shall become the
        avenger. This fourth murder is apparent to all, and if thy father abandon
        thee, Valentine, it is I, and I swear it, that shall pursue the assassin.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And this time, as though nature had at least taken compassion on the
        vigorous frame, nearly bursting with its own strength, the words of Morrel
        were stifled in his throat; his breast heaved; the tears, so long
        rebellious, gushed from his eyes; and he threw himself weeping on his
        knees by the side of the bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then d&rsquo;Avrigny spoke. &ldquo;And I, too,&rdquo; he exclaimed in a
        low voice, &ldquo;I unite with M. Morrel in demanding justice for crime;
        my blood boils at the idea of having encouraged a murderer by my cowardly
        concession.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, merciful Heavens!&rdquo; murmured Villefort. Morrel raised his
        head, and reading the eyes of the old man, which gleamed with unnatural
        lustre,&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;M. Noirtier wishes to speak.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; indicated Noirtier, with an expression the more
        terrible, from all his faculties being centred in his glance.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know the assassin?&rdquo; asked Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Noirtier.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And will you direct us?&rdquo; exclaimed the young man. &ldquo;Listen,
        M. d&rsquo;Avrigny, listen!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Noirtier looked upon Morrel with one of those melancholy smiles which had so
        often made Valentine happy, and thus fixed his attention. Then, having riveted
        the eyes of his interlocutor on his own, he glanced towards the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you wish me to leave?&rdquo; said Morrel, sadly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Noirtier.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas, alas, sir, have pity on me!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The old man&rsquo;s eyes remained fixed on the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;May I, at least, return?&rdquo; asked Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Must I leave alone?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Whom am I to take with me? The procureur?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The doctor?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You wish to remain alone with M. de Villefort?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But can he understand you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Villefort, inexpressibly delighted to think that
        the inquiries were to be made by him alone,&mdash;&ldquo;oh, be satisfied,
        I can understand my father.&rdquo; While uttering these words with this
        expression of joy, his teeth clashed together violently.
      </p>
      <p>
        D&rsquo;Avrigny took the young man&rsquo;s arm, and led him out of the room. A
        more than deathlike silence then reigned in the house. At the end of a quarter of
        an hour a faltering footstep was heard, and Villefort appeared at the door of
        the apartment where d&rsquo;Avrigny and Morrel had been staying, one absorbed in
        meditation, the other in grief.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You can come,&rdquo; he said, and led them back to Noirtier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel looked attentively on Villefort. His face was livid, large drops rolled
        down his face, and in his fingers he held the fragments of a quill pen which he
        had torn to atoms.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said in a hoarse voice, &ldquo;give me your
        word of honor that this horrible secret shall forever remain buried
        amongst ourselves!&rdquo; The two men drew back.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I entreat you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; continued Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Morrel, &ldquo;the culprit&mdash;the murderer&mdash;the
        assassin.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do not alarm yourself, sir; justice will be done,&rdquo; said
        Villefort. &ldquo;My father has revealed the culprit&rsquo;s name; my
        father thirsts for revenge as much as you do, yet even he conjures you as
        I do to keep this secret. Do you not, father?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; resolutely replied Noirtier. Morrel suffered an
        exclamation of horror and surprise to escape him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; said Villefort, arresting Maximilian by the arm, &ldquo;if
        my father, the inflexible man, makes this request, it is because he knows, be
        assured, that Valentine will be terribly revenged. Is it not so, father?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The old man made a sign in the affirmative. Villefort continued:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He knows me, and I have pledged my word to him. Rest assured, gentlemen,
        that within three days, in a less time than justice would demand, the revenge I
        shall have taken for the murder of my child will be such as to make the
        boldest heart tremble;&rdquo; and as he spoke these words he ground his
        teeth, and grasped the old man&rsquo;s senseless hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Will this promise be fulfilled, M. Noirtier?&rdquo; asked Morrel,
        while d&rsquo;Avrigny looked inquiringly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Noirtier with an expression of sinister joy.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Swear, then,&rdquo; said Villefort, joining the hands of Morrel and
        d&rsquo;Avrigny, &ldquo;swear that you will spare the honor of my house,
        and leave me to avenge my child.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        D&rsquo;Avrigny turned round and uttered a very feeble &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;
        but Morrel, disengaging his hand, rushed to the bed, and after having pressed
        the cold lips of Valentine with his own, hurriedly left, uttering a long, deep
        groan of despair and anguish.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have before stated that all the servants had fled. M. de Villefort was
        therefore obliged to request M. d&rsquo;Avrigny to superintend all the
        arrangements consequent upon a death in a large city, more especially a death
        under such suspicious circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was something terrible to witness the silent agony, the mute despair of
        Noirtier, whose tears silently rolled down his cheeks. Villefort retired
        to his study, and d&rsquo;Avrigny left to summon the doctor of the
        mayoralty, whose office it is to examine bodies after decease, and who is
        expressly named &ldquo;the doctor of the dead.&rdquo; M. Noirtier could
        not be persuaded to quit his grandchild. At the end of a quarter of an
        hour M. d&rsquo;Avrigny returned with his associate; they found the outer
        gate closed, and not a servant remaining in the house; Villefort himself
        was obliged to open to them. But he stopped on the landing; he had not the
        courage to again visit the death chamber. The two doctors, therefore,
        entered the room alone. Noirtier was near the bed, pale, motionless, and
        silent as the corpse. The district doctor approached with the indifference
        of a man accustomed to spend half his time amongst the dead; he then
        lifted the sheet which was placed over the face, and just unclosed the
        lips.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Avrigny, &ldquo;she is indeed dead, poor
        child!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50099m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the doctor laconically, dropping the sheet he
        had raised. Noirtier uttered a kind of hoarse, rattling sound; the old man&rsquo;s
        eyes sparkled, and the good doctor understood that he wished to behold his
        child. He therefore approached the bed, and while his companion was
        dipping the fingers with which he had touched the lips of the corpse in
        chloride of lime, he uncovered the calm and pale face, which looked like
        that of a sleeping angel.
      </p>
      <p>
        A tear, which appeared in the old man&rsquo;s eye, expressed his thanks to the
        doctor. The doctor of the dead then laid his permit on the corner of the table,
        and having fulfilled his duty, was conducted out by d&rsquo;Avrigny. Villefort
        met them at the door of his study; having in a few words thanked the district
        doctor, he turned to d&rsquo;Avrigny, and said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And now the priest.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is there any particular priest you wish to pray with Valentine?&rdquo;
        asked d&rsquo;Avrigny.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo; said Villefort; &ldquo;fetch the nearest.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The nearest,&rdquo; said the district doctor, &ldquo;is a good
        Italian abbé, who lives next door to you. Shall I call on him as I pass?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;D&rsquo;Avrigny,&rdquo; said Villefort, &ldquo;be so kind, I
        beseech you, as to accompany this gentleman. Here is the key of the door,
        so that you can go in and out as you please; you will bring the priest
        with you, and will oblige me by introducing him into my child&rsquo;s
        room.&rdquo;

        &ldquo;Do you wish to see him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I only wish to be alone. You will excuse me, will you not? A priest
        can understand a father&rsquo;s grief.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And M. de Villefort, giving the key to d&rsquo;Avrigny, again bade farewell to
        the strange doctor, and retired to his study, where he began to work. For some
        temperaments work is a remedy for all afflictions.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the doctors entered the street, they saw a man in a cassock standing on the
        threshold of the next door.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This is the abbé of whom I spoke,&rdquo; said the doctor to d&rsquo;Avrigny.
        D&rsquo;Avrigny accosted the priest.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are you disposed to confer a great obligation
        on an unhappy father who has just lost his daughter? I mean M. de Villefort,
        the king&rsquo;s attorney.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the priest, in a marked Italian accent; &ldquo;yes,
        I have heard that death is in that house.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then I need not tell you what kind of service he requires of you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I was about to offer myself, sir,&rdquo; said the priest; &ldquo;it
        is our mission to forestall our duties.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is a young girl.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I know it, sir; the servants who fled from the house informed me. I
        also know that her name is Valentine, and I have already prayed for her.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Avrigny; &ldquo;since you have
        commenced your sacred office, deign to continue it. Come and watch by the
        dead, and all the wretched family will be grateful to you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am going, sir; and I do not hesitate to say that no prayers will
        be more fervent than mine.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        D&rsquo;Avrigny took the priest&rsquo;s hand, and without meeting Villefort, who
        was engaged in his study, they reached Valentine&rsquo;s room, which on the
        following night was to be occupied by the undertakers. On entering the room,
        Noirtier&rsquo;s eyes met those of the abbé, and no doubt he read some particular
        expression in them, for he remained in the room. D&rsquo;Avrigny recommended the
        attention of the priest to the living as well as to the dead, and the abbé
        promised to devote his prayers to Valentine and his attentions to Noirtier.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order, doubtless, that he might not be disturbed while fulfilling his
        sacred mission, the priest rose as soon as d&rsquo;Avrigny departed, and
        not only bolted the door through which the doctor had just left, but also
        that leading to Madame de Villefort&rsquo;s room.
