      <h2>Chapter 35. La Mazzolata</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">G</span>entlemen,&rdquo;
        said the Count of Monte Cristo as he entered, &ldquo;I pray you excuse me
        for suffering my visit to be anticipated; but I feared to disturb you by
        presenting myself earlier at your apartments; besides, you sent me word
        that you would come to me, and I have held myself at your disposal.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Franz and I have to thank you a thousand times, count,&rdquo;
        returned Albert; &ldquo;you extricated us from a great dilemma, and we
        were on the point of inventing a very fantastic vehicle when your friendly
        invitation reached us.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; returned the count, motioning the two young men to
        sit down. &ldquo;It was the fault of that blockhead Pastrini, that I did
        not sooner assist you in your distress. He did not mention a syllable of
        your embarrassment to me, when he knows that, alone and isolated as I am,
        I seek every opportunity of making the acquaintance of my neighbors. As
        soon as I learned I could in any way assist you, I most eagerly seized the
        opportunity of offering my services.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The two young men bowed. Franz had, as yet, found nothing to say; he had come to
        no determination, and as nothing in the count&rsquo;s manner manifested the wish
        that he should recognize him, he did not know whether to make any allusion to the
        past, or wait until he had more proof; besides, although sure it was he who had
        been in the box the previous evening, he could not be equally positive
        that this was the man he had seen at the Colosseum. He resolved,
        therefore, to let things take their course without making any direct
        overture to the count. Moreover, he had this advantage, he was master of
        the count&rsquo;s secret, while the count had no hold on Franz, who had
        nothing to conceal. However, he resolved to lead the conversation to a
        subject which might possibly clear up his doubts.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Count,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have offered us places in your
        carriage, and at your windows in the Rospoli Palace. Can you tell us where
        we can obtain a sight of the Piazza del Popolo?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the count negligently, looking attentively at
        Morcerf, &ldquo;is there not something like an execution upon the Piazza
        del Popolo?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Franz, finding that the count was coming to
        the point he wished.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Stay, I think I told my steward yesterday to attend to this;
        perhaps I can render you this slight service also.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He extended his hand, and rang the bell thrice.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you ever occupy yourself,&rdquo; said he to Franz, &ldquo;with the
        employment of time and the means of simplifying the summoning your servants? I
        have. When I ring once, it is for my valet; twice, for my majordomo; thrice, for
        my steward,&mdash;thus I do not waste a minute or a word. Here he is.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        A man of about forty-five or fifty entered, exactly resembling the smuggler who
        had introduced Franz into the cavern; but he did not appear to recognize him.
        It was evident he had his orders.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Monsieur Bertuccio,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;you have procured me
        windows looking on the Piazza del Popolo, as I ordered you yesterday.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, excellency,&rdquo; returned the steward; &ldquo;but it was
        very late.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did I not tell you I wished for one?&rdquo; replied the count,
        frowning.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And your excellency has one, which was let to Prince Lobanieff; but
        I was obliged to pay a hundred&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That will do&mdash;that will do, Monsieur Bertuccio; spare these
        gentlemen all such domestic arrangements. You have the window, that is
        sufficient. Give orders to the coachman; and be in readiness on the stairs
        to conduct us to it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The steward bowed, and was about to quit the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; continued the count, &ldquo;be good enough to ask Pastrini if
        he has received the <i>tavoletta</i>, and if he can send us an account of the
        execution.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There is no need to do that,&rdquo; said Franz, taking out his
        tablets; &ldquo;for I saw the account, and copied it down.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well, you can retire, M. Bertuccio; I need you no longer. Let us know
        when breakfast is ready. These gentlemen,&rdquo; added he, turning to the two
        friends, &ldquo;will, I trust, do me the honor to breakfast with me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But, my dear count,&rdquo; said Albert, &ldquo;we shall abuse your
        kindness.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not at all; on the contrary, you will give me great pleasure. You
        will, one or other of you, perhaps both, return it to me at Paris. M.
        Bertuccio, lay covers for three.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He then took Franz&rsquo;s tablets out of his hand. &ldquo;&lsquo;We
        announce,&rsquo; he read, in the same tone with which he would have read a
        newspaper, &lsquo;that today, the 23rd of February, will be executed Andrea Rondolo,
        guilty of murder on the person of the respected and venerated Don César Torlini,
        canon of the church of St. John Lateran, and Peppino, called Rocca Priori,
        convicted of complicity with the detestable bandit Luigi Vampa, and the men of his
        band.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Hum! &lsquo;The first will be <i>mazzolato</i>, the second
        <i>decapitato</i>.&rsquo; Yes,&rdquo; continued the count, &ldquo;it was at first
        arranged in this way; but I think since yesterday some change has taken place in
        the order of the ceremony.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I passed the evening at the Cardinal Rospigliosi&rsquo;s, and
        there mention was made of something like a pardon for one of the two men.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;For Andrea Rondolo?&rdquo; asked Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the count, carelessly; &ldquo;for the other (he
        glanced at the tablets as if to recall the name), for Peppino, called
        Rocca Priori. You are thus deprived of seeing a man guillotined; but the
        <i>mazzolata</i> still remains, which is a very curious punishment when
        seen for the first time, and even the second, while the other, as you must
        know, is very simple.
        The <i>mandaïa</i><a href="#linknote-6" name="linknoteref-6" id="linknoteref-6">6</a> never
        fails, never trembles, never strikes thirty times ineffectually, like the soldier
        who beheaded the Count of Chalais, and to whose tender mercy Richelieu had
        doubtless recommended the sufferer. Ah,&rdquo; added the count, in a contemptuous
        tone, &ldquo;do not tell me of European punishments, they are in the
        infancy, or rather the old age, of cruelty.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Really, count,&rdquo; replied Franz, &ldquo;one would think that
        you had studied the different tortures of all the nations of the world.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There are, at least, few that I have not seen,&rdquo; said the
        count coldly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you took pleasure in beholding these dreadful spectacles?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My first sentiment was horror, the second indifference, the third
        curiosity.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Curiosity&mdash;that is a terrible word.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why so? In life, our greatest preoccupation is death; is it not
        then, curious to study the different ways by which the soul and body can
        part; and how, according to their different characters, temperaments, and
        even the different customs of their countries, different persons bear the
        transition from life to death, from existence to annihilation? As for
        myself, I can assure you of one thing,&mdash;the more men you see die, the
        easier it becomes to die yourself; and in my opinion, death may be a
        torture, but it is not an expiation.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not quite understand you,&rdquo; replied Franz; &ldquo;pray
        explain your meaning, for you excite my curiosity to the highest pitch.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said the count, and deep hatred mounted to his face,
        as the blood would to the face of any other. &ldquo;If a man had by
        unheard-of and excruciating tortures destroyed your father, your mother,
        your betrothed,&mdash;a being who, when torn from you, left a desolation,
        a wound that never closes, in your breast,&mdash;do you think the
        reparation that society gives you is sufficient when it interposes the
        knife of the guillotine between the base of the occiput and the trapezal
        muscles of the murderer, and allows him who has caused us years of moral
        sufferings to escape with a few moments of physical pain?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I know,&rdquo; said Franz, &ldquo;that human justice is
        insufficient to console us; she can give blood in return for blood, that
        is all; but you must demand from her only what it is in her power to
        grant.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will put another case to you,&rdquo; continued the count; &ldquo;that
        where society, attacked by the death of a person, avenges death by death.
        But are there not a thousand tortures by which a man may be made to suffer
        without society taking the least cognizance of them, or offering him even
        the insufficient means of vengeance, of which we have just spoken? Are
        there not crimes for which the impalement of the Turks, the augers of the
        Persians, the stake and the brand of the Iroquois Indians, are inadequate
        tortures, and which are unpunished by society? Answer me, do not these
        crimes exist?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Franz; &ldquo;and it is to punish them that
        duelling is tolerated.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, duelling,&rdquo; cried the count; &ldquo;a pleasant manner,
        upon my soul, of arriving at your end when that end is vengeance! A man
        has carried off your mistress, a man has seduced your wife, a man has
        dishonored your daughter; he has rendered the whole life of one who had
        the right to expect from Heaven that portion of happiness God has promised
        to everyone of his creatures, an existence of misery and infamy; and you
        think you are avenged because you send a ball through the head, or pass a
        sword through the breast, of that man who has planted madness in your
        brain, and despair in your heart. And remember, moreover, that it is often
        he who comes off victorious from the strife, absolved of all crime in the
        eyes of the world. No, no,&rdquo; continued the count, &ldquo;had I to
        avenge myself, it is not thus I would take revenge.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you disapprove of duelling? You would not fight a duel?&rdquo;
        asked Albert in his turn, astonished at this strange theory.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; replied the count; &ldquo;understand me, I would
        fight a duel for a trifle, for an insult, for a blow; and the more so
        that, thanks to my skill in all bodily exercises, and the indifference to
        danger I have gradually acquired, I should be almost certain to kill my
        man. Oh, I would fight for such a cause; but in return for a slow,
        profound, eternal torture, I would give back the same, were it possible;
        an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, as the Orientalists say,&mdash;our
        masters in everything,&mdash;those favored creatures who have formed for
        themselves a life of dreams and a paradise of realities.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Franz to the count, &ldquo;with this theory, which
        renders you at once judge and executioner of your own cause, it would be
        difficult to adopt a course that would forever prevent your falling under
        the power of the law. Hatred is blind, rage carries you away; and he who
        pours out vengeance runs the risk of tasting a bitter draught.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, if he be poor and inexperienced, not if he be rich and
        skilful; besides, the worst that could happen to him would be the
        punishment of which we have already spoken, and which the philanthropic
        French Revolution has substituted for being torn to pieces by horses or
        broken on the wheel. What matters this punishment, as long as he is
        avenged? On my word, I almost regret that in all probability this
        miserable Peppino will not be beheaded, as you might have had an
        opportunity then of seeing how short a time the punishment lasts, and
        whether it is worth even mentioning; but, really this is a most singular
        conversation for the Carnival, gentlemen; how did it arise? Ah, I
        recollect, you asked for a place at my window; you shall have it; but let
        us first sit down to table, for here comes the servant to inform us that
        breakfast is ready.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        As he spoke, a servant opened one of the four doors of the apartment, saying:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Al suo commodo!</i>&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The two young men arose and entered the breakfast-room.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the meal, which was excellent, and admirably served, Franz looked
        repeatedly at Albert, in order to observe the impressions which he doubted
        not had been made on him by the words of their entertainer; but whether
        with his usual carelessness he had paid but little attention to him,
        whether the explanation of the Count of Monte Cristo with regard to
        duelling had satisfied him, or whether the events which Franz knew of had
        had their effect on him alone, he remarked that his companion did not pay
        the least regard to them, but on the contrary ate like a man who for the
        last four or five months had been condemned to partake of Italian cookery&mdash;that
        is, the worst in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the count, he just touched the dishes; he seemed to fulfil the duties of a
        host by sitting down with his guests, and awaited their departure to be served
        with some strange or more delicate food. This brought back to Franz, in spite of
        himself, the recollection of the terror with which the count had inspired the
        Countess G&mdash;&mdash;, and her firm conviction that the man in the opposite box
        was a vampire.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the breakfast Franz took out his watch.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;what are you doing?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You must excuse us, count,&rdquo; returned Franz, &ldquo;but we
        have still much to do.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What may that be?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We have no masks, and it is absolutely necessary to procure them.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do not concern yourself about that; we have, I think, a private
        room in the Piazza del Popolo; I will have whatever costumes you choose
        brought to us, and you can dress there.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;After the execution?&rdquo; cried Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Before or after, whichever you please.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Opposite the scaffold?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The scaffold forms part of the <i>fête</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Count, I have reflected on the matter,&rdquo; said Franz, &ldquo;I
        thank you for your courtesy, but I shall content myself with accepting a
        place in your carriage and at your window at the Rospoli Palace, and I
        leave you at liberty to dispose of my place at the Piazza del Popolo.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But I warn you, you will lose a very curious sight,&rdquo; returned
        the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You will describe it to me,&rdquo; replied Franz, &ldquo;and the
        recital from your lips will make as great an impression on me as if I had
        witnessed it. I have more than once intended witnessing an execution, but
        I have never been able to make up my mind; and you, Albert?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I,&rdquo; replied the viscount,&mdash;&ldquo;I saw Castaing
        executed, but I think I was rather intoxicated that day, for I had quitted
        college the same morning, and we had passed the previous night at a
        tavern.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Besides, it is no reason because you have not seen an execution at
        Paris, that you should not see one anywhere else; when you travel, it is
        to see everything. Think what a figure you will make when you are asked,
        &lsquo;How do they execute at Rome?&rsquo; and you reply, &lsquo;I do not
        know!&rsquo; And, besides, they say that the culprit is an infamous
        scoundrel, who killed with a log of wood a worthy canon who had brought
        him up like his own son. <i>Diable!</i> when a churchman is killed, it
        should be with a different weapon than a log, especially when he has
        behaved like a father. If you went to Spain, would you not see the
        bull-fights? Well, suppose it is a bull-fight you are going to see?
        Recollect the ancient Romans of the Circus, and the sports where they
        killed three hundred lions and a hundred men. Think of the eighty thousand
        applauding spectators, the sage matrons who took their daughters, and the
        charming Vestals who made with the thumb of their white hands the fatal
        sign that said, &lsquo;Come, despatch the dying.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall you go, then, Albert?&rdquo; asked Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Ma foi</i>, yes; like you, I hesitated, but the count&rsquo;s
        eloquence decides me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us go, then,&rdquo; said Franz, &ldquo;since you wish it; but
        on our way to the Piazza del Popolo, I wish to pass through the Corso. Is
        this possible, count?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On foot, yes, in a carriage, no.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will go on foot, then.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is it important that you should go that way?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, there is something I wish to see.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, we will go by the Corso. We will send the carriage to wait
        for us on the Piazza del Popolo, by the Via del Babuino, for I shall be
        glad to pass, myself, through the Corso, to see if some orders I have
        given have been executed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Excellency,&rdquo; said a servant, opening the door, &ldquo;a man
        in the dress of a penitent wishes to speak to you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah! yes,&rdquo; returned the count, &ldquo;I know who he is,
        gentlemen; will you return to the salon? you will find good cigars on the
        centre table. I will be with you directly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The young men rose and returned into the salon, while the count, again apologizing,
        left by another door. Albert, who was a great smoker, and who had considered it no
        small sacrifice to be deprived of the cigars of the Café de Paris,
        approached the table, and uttered a cry of joy at perceiving some
        veritable <i>puros</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; asked Franz, &ldquo;what think you of the Count of
        Monte Cristo?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do I think?&rdquo; said Albert, evidently surprised at such a
        question from his companion; &ldquo;I think he is a delightful fellow, who
        does the honors of his table admirably; who has travelled much, read much,
        is, like Brutus, of the Stoic school, and moreover,&rdquo; added he,
        sending a volume of smoke up towards the ceiling, &ldquo;that he has
        excellent cigars.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Such was Albert&rsquo;s opinion of the count, and as Franz well knew that Albert
        professed never to form an opinion except upon long reflection, he made no
        attempt to change it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;did you observe one very singular thing?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How attentively he looked at you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Albert reflected. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; replied he, sighing, &ldquo;that is
        not very surprising; I have been more than a year absent from Paris, and
        my clothes are of a most antiquated cut; the count takes me for a
        provincial. The first opportunity you have, undeceive him, I beg, and tell
        him I am nothing of the kind.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz smiled; an instant after the count entered.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am now quite at your service, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;The
        carriage is going one way to the Piazza del Popolo, and we will go
        another; and, if you please, by the Corso. Take some more of these cigars,
        M. de Morcerf.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; returned Albert; &ldquo;Italian cigars
        are horrible. When you come to Paris, I will return all this.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will not refuse; I intend going there soon, and since you allow
        me, I will pay you a visit. Come, we have not any time to lose, it is
        half-past twelve&mdash;let us set off.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        All three descended; the coachman received his master&rsquo;s orders, and drove
        down the Via del Babuino. While the three gentlemen walked along the Piazza di
        Spagna and the Via Frattina, which led directly between the Fiano and Rospoli
        palaces, Franz&rsquo;s attention was directed towards the windows of that
        last palace, for he had not forgotten the signal agreed upon between the
        man in the mantle and the Transtevere peasant.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Which are your windows?&rdquo; asked he of the count, with as much
        indifference as he could assume.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The three last,&rdquo; returned he, with a negligence evidently unaffected,
        for he could not imagine with what intention the question was put.
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz glanced rapidly towards the three windows. The side windows were hung with
        yellow damask, and the centre one with white damask and a red cross. The man in
        the mantle had kept his promise to the Transteverin, and there could now be no
        doubt that he was the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        The three windows were still untenanted. Preparations were making on every side;
        chairs were placed, scaffolds were raised, and windows were hung with flags. The
        masks could not appear; the carriages could not move about; but the masks were
        visible behind the windows, the carriages, and the doors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz, Albert, and the count continued to descend the Corso. As they
        approached the Piazza del Popolo, the crowd became more dense, and above
        the heads of the multitude two objects were visible: the obelisk,
        surmounted by a cross, which marks the centre of the square, and in front
        of the obelisk, at the point where the three streets, del Babuino, del
        Corso, and di Ripetta, meet, the two uprights of the scaffold, between
        which glittered the curved knife of the <i>mandaïa</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the corner of the street they met the count&rsquo;s steward, who was
        awaiting his master. The window, let at an exorbitant price, which the
        count had doubtless wished to conceal from his guests, was on the second
        floor of the great palace, situated between the Via del Babuino and the
        Monte Pincio. It consisted, as we have said, of a small dressing-room,
        opening into a bedroom, and, when the door of communication was shut, the
        inmates were quite alone. On chairs were laid elegant masquerade costumes
        of blue and white satin.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20167m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As you left the choice of your costumes to me,&rdquo; said the count to the
        two friends, &ldquo;I have had these brought, as they will be the most worn this
        year; and they are most suitable, on account of the <i>confetti</i> (sweetmeats),
        as they do not show the flour.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz heard the words of the count but imperfectly, and he perhaps did not
        fully appreciate this new attention to their wishes; for he was wholly
        absorbed by the spectacle that the Piazza del Popolo presented, and by the
        terrible instrument that was in the centre.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was the first time Franz had ever seen a guillotine,&mdash;we say guillotine,
        because the Roman <i>mandaïa</i> is formed on almost the same model as the French
        instrument.<a href="#linknote-7" name="linknoteref-7" id="linknoteref-7">7</a> The
        knife, which is shaped like a crescent, that cuts with the convex side,
        falls from a less height, and that is all the difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two men, seated on the movable plank on which the victim is laid, were eating their
        breakfasts, while waiting for the criminal. Their repast consisted
        apparently of bread and sausages. One of them lifted the plank, took out a
        flask of wine, drank some, and then passed it to his companion. These two
        men were the executioner&rsquo;s assistants.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this sight Franz felt the perspiration start forth upon his brow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The prisoners, transported the previous evening from the Carceri Nuove to the
        little church of Santa Maria del Popolo, had passed the night, each accompanied by
        two priests, in a chapel closed by a grating, before which were two sentinels, who
        were relieved at intervals. A double line of carbineers, placed on each side of
        the door of the church, reached to the scaffold, and formed a circle
        around it, leaving a path about ten feet wide, and around the guillotine a
        space of nearly a hundred feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the rest of the square was paved with heads. Many women held their infants on
        their shoulders, and thus the children had the best view. The Monte Pincio seemed
        a vast amphitheatre filled with spectators; the balconies of the two churches at
        the corner of the Via del Babuino and the Via di Ripetta were crammed; the steps
        even seemed a parti-colored sea, that was impelled towards the portico; every
        niche in the wall held its living statue. What the count said was true&mdash;the
        most curious spectacle in life is that of death.
      </p>
      <p>
        And yet, instead of the silence and the solemnity demanded by the occasion,
        laughter and jests arose from the crowd. It was evident that the execution was, in
        the eyes of the people, only the commencement of the Carnival.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly the tumult ceased, as if by magic, and the doors of the church opened. A
        brotherhood of penitents, clothed from head to foot in robes of gray sackcloth,
        with holes for the eyes, and holding in their hands lighted tapers, appeared
        first; the chief marched at the head.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20169m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        Behind the penitents came a man of vast stature and proportions. He was naked,
        with the exception of cloth drawers at the left side of which hung a large knife
        in a sheath, and he bore on his right shoulder a heavy iron sledge-hammer.
      </p>
      <p>
        This man was the executioner.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had, moreover, sandals bound on his feet by cords.
      </p>
      <p>
        Behind the executioner came, in the order in which they were to die, first Peppino
        and then Andrea. Each was accompanied by two priests. Neither had his eyes bandaged.
      </p>
      <p>
        Peppino walked with a firm step, doubtless aware of what awaited him. Andrea was
        supported by two priests. Each of them, from time to time, kissed the
        crucifix a confessor held out to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this sight alone Franz felt his legs tremble under him. He looked at
        Albert&mdash;he was as white as his shirt, and mechanically cast away his cigar,
        although he had not half smoked it. The count alone seemed unmoved&mdash;nay, more,
        a slight color seemed striving to rise in his pale cheeks. His nostrils dilated
        like those of a wild beast that scents its prey, and his lips, half opened,
        disclosed his white teeth, small and sharp like those of a jackal. And yet
        his features wore an expression of smiling tenderness, such as Franz had
        never before witnessed in them; his black eyes especially were full of
        kindness and pity.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the two culprits advanced, and as they approached their faces became
        visible. Peppino was a handsome young man of four or five-and-twenty, bronzed by
        the sun; he carried his head erect, and seemed on the watch to see on which side
        his liberator would appear. Andrea was short and fat; his visage, marked with
        brutal cruelty, did not indicate age; he might be thirty. In prison he had suffered
        his beard to grow; his head fell on his shoulder, his legs bent beneath him, and
        his movements were apparently automatic and unconscious.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; said Franz to the count, &ldquo;that you told me
        there would be but one execution.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I told you true,&rdquo; replied he coldly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And yet here are two culprits.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; but only one of these two is about to die; the other has many
        years to live.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If the pardon is to come, there is no time to lose.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And see, here it is,&rdquo; said the count. At the moment when
        Peppino reached the foot of the <i>mandaïa</i>, a priest arrived in some
        haste, forced his way through the soldiers, and, advancing to the chief of
        the brotherhood, gave him a folded paper. The piercing eye of Peppino had
        noticed all. The chief took the paper, unfolded it, and, raising his hand,
        &ldquo;Heaven be praised, and his Holiness also,&rdquo; said he in a loud
        voice; &ldquo;here is a pardon for one of the prisoners!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A pardon!&rdquo; cried the people with one voice; &ldquo;a pardon!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At this cry Andrea raised his head.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Pardon for whom?&rdquo; cried he.
      </p>
      <p>
        Peppino remained breathless.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A pardon for Peppino, called Rocca Priori,&rdquo; said the principal friar.
        And he passed the paper to the officer commanding the carbineers, who read and
        returned it to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;For Peppino!&rdquo; cried Andrea, who seemed roused from the torpor
        in which he had been plunged. &ldquo;Why for him and not for me? We ought
        to die together. I was promised he should die with me. You have no right
        to put me to death alone. I will not die alone&mdash;I will not!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And he broke from the priests struggling and raving like a wild beast, and
        striving desperately to break the cords that bound his hands. The
        executioner made a sign, and his two assistants leaped from the scaffold
        and seized him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is going on?&rdquo; asked Franz of the count; for, as all the talk was
        in the Roman dialect, he had not perfectly understood it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you not see?&rdquo; returned the count, &ldquo;that this human creature
        who is about to die is furious that his fellow-sufferer does not perish with him?
        and, were he able, he would rather tear him to pieces with his teeth and nails than
        let him enjoy the life he himself is about to be deprived of. Oh, man,
        man&mdash;race of crocodiles,&rdquo; cried the count, extending his clenched hands
        towards the crowd, &ldquo;how well do I recognize you there, and that at all times
        you are worthy of yourselves!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile Andrea and the two executioners were struggling on the ground, and he
        kept exclaiming, &ldquo;He ought to die!&mdash;he shall die!&mdash;I will not
        die alone!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Look, look,&rdquo; cried the count, seizing the young men&rsquo;s
        hands; &ldquo;look, for on my soul it is curious. Here is a man who
        had resigned himself to his fate, who was going to the scaffold to die&mdash;like
        a coward, it is true, but he was about to die without resistance. Do you
        know what gave him strength? do you know what consoled him? It was,
        that another partook of his punishment&mdash;that another partook of his
        anguish&mdash;that another was to die before him! Lead two sheep to the
        butcher&rsquo;s, two oxen to the slaughterhouse, and make one of them
        understand that his companion will not die; the sheep will bleat for
        pleasure, the ox will bellow with joy. But man&mdash;man, whom God created
        in his own image&mdash;man, upon whom God has laid his first, his sole
        commandment, to love his neighbor&mdash;man, to whom God has given a voice
        to express his thoughts&mdash;what is his first cry when he hears his
        fellow-man is saved? A blasphemy. Honor to man, this masterpiece of
        nature, this king of the creation!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And the count burst into a laugh; a terrible laugh, that showed he must have
        suffered horribly to be able thus to laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the struggle still continued, and it was dreadful to witness. The
        two assistants carried Andrea up to the scaffold; the people all took part
        against Andrea, and twenty thousand voices cried, &ldquo;Put him to death!
        put him to death!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz sprang back, but the count seized his arm, and held him before the window.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Do you pity him? If you heard the
        cry of &lsquo;Mad dog!&rsquo; you would take your gun&mdash;you would unhesitatingly
        shoot the poor beast, who, after all, was only guilty of having been bitten by
        another dog. And yet you pity a man who, without being bitten by one of his race,
        has yet murdered his benefactor; and who, now unable to kill anyone, because his
        hands are bound, wishes to see his companion in captivity perish. No, no&mdash;look,
        look!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20172m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        The recommendation was needless. Franz was fascinated by the horrible spectacle.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two assistants had borne Andrea to the scaffold, and there,
        in spite of his struggles, his bites, and his cries, had forced him to his
        knees. During this time the executioner had raised his mace, and signed to
        them to get out of the way; the criminal strove to rise, but, ere he had
        time, the mace fell on his left temple. A dull and heavy sound was heard,
        and the man dropped like an ox on his face, and then turned over on his
        back.
      </p>
      <p>
        The executioner let fall his mace, drew his knife, and with one
        stroke opened his throat, and mounting on his stomach, stamped violently
        on it with his feet. At every stroke a jet of blood sprang from the wound.
      </p>
      <p>
        This time Franz could contain himself no longer, but sank, half fainting,
        into a seat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Albert, with his eyes closed, was standing grasping the window-curtains.
      </p>
      <p>
        The count was erect and triumphant, like the Avenging Angel!
