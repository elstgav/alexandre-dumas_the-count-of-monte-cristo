      <h2>Chapter 63. The Dinner</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was evident that
        one sentiment affected all the guests on entering the dining-room. Each
        one asked what strange influence had brought them to this house, and yet
        astonished, even uneasy though they were, they still felt that they would
        not like to be absent. The recent events, the solitary and eccentric
        position of the count, his enormous, nay, almost incredible fortune,
        should have made men cautious, and have altogether prevented ladies
        visiting a house where there was no one of their own sex to receive them;
        and yet curiosity had been enough to lead them to overleap the bounds of
        prudence and decorum.
      </p>
      <p>
        And all present, even including Cavalcanti and his son, notwithstanding the
        stiffness of the one and the carelessness of the other, were thoughtful, on
        finding themselves assembled at the house of this incomprehensible man. Madame
        Danglars had started when Villefort, on the count&rsquo;s invitation, offered his
        arm; and Villefort felt that his glance was uneasy beneath his gold spectacles,
        when he felt the arm of the baroness press upon his own. None of this had escaped
        the count, and even by this mere contact of individuals the scene had already
        acquired considerable interest for an observer.
      </p>
      <p>
        M. de Villefort had on the right hand Madame Danglars, on his left Morrel. The
        count was seated between Madame de Villefort and Danglars; the other seats were
        filled by Debray, who was placed between the two Cavalcanti, and by Château-Renaud,
        seated between Madame de Villefort and Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The repast was magnificent; Monte Cristo had endeavored completely to
        overturn the Parisian ideas, and to feed the curiosity as much as the
        appetite of his guests. It was an Oriental feast that he offered to them,
        but of such a kind as the Arabian fairies might be supposed to prepare.
        Every delicious fruit that the four quarters of the globe could provide
        was heaped in vases from China and jars from Japan. Rare birds, retaining
        their most brilliant plumage, enormous fish, spread upon massive silver
        dishes, together with every wine produced in the Archipelago, Asia Minor,
        or the Cape, sparkling in bottles, whose grotesque shape seemed to give an
        additional flavor to the draught,&mdash;all these, like one of the
        displays with which Apicius of old gratified his guests, passed in review
        before the eyes of the astonished Parisians, who understood that it was
        possible to expend a thousand louis upon a dinner for ten persons, but
        only on the condition of eating pearls, like Cleopatra, or drinking
        refined gold, like Lorenzo de&rsquo; Medici.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo noticed the general astonishment, and began laughing and
        joking about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will admit that, when arrived at a
        certain degree of fortune, the superfluities of life are all that can be desired;
        and the ladies will allow that, after having risen to a certain eminence of
        position, the ideal alone can be more exalted. Now, to follow out this reasoning,
        what is the marvellous?&mdash;that which we do not understand. What is it that we
        really desire?&mdash;that which we cannot obtain. Now, to see things which I cannot
        understand, to procure impossibilities, these are the study of my life. I gratify
        my wishes by two means&mdash;my will and my money. I take as much interest in
        the pursuit of some whim as you do, M. Danglars, in promoting a new
        railway line; you, M. de Villefort, in condemning a culprit to death; you,
        M. Debray, in pacifying a kingdom; you, M. de Château-Renaud, in pleasing
        a woman; and you, Morrel, in breaking a horse that no one can ride. For
        example, you see these two fish; one brought from fifty leagues beyond St.
        Petersburg, the other five leagues from Naples. Is it not amusing to see
        them both on the same table?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What are the two fish?&rdquo; asked Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. Château-Renaud, who has lived in Russia, will tell you the name
        of one, and Major Cavalcanti, who is an Italian, will tell you the name of
        the other.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This one is, I think, a sterlet,&rdquo; said Château-Renaud.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And that one, if I mistake not, a lamprey.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Just so. Now, M. Danglars, ask these gentlemen where they are
        caught.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sterlets,&rdquo; said Château-Renaud, &ldquo;are only found in the
        Volga.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Cavalcanti, &ldquo;I know that Lake Fusaro alone
        supplies lampreys of that size.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Exactly; one comes from the Volga, and the other from Lake Fusaro.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo; cried all the guests simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, this is just what amuses me,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo.
        &ldquo;I am like Nero&mdash;<i>cupitor impossibilium</i>; and that is what
        is amusing you at this moment. This fish, which seems so exquisite to you,
        is very likely no better than perch or salmon; but it seemed impossible to
        procure it, and here it is.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But how could you have these fish brought to France?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, nothing more easy. Each fish was brought over in a cask&mdash;one
        filled with river herbs and weeds, the other with rushes and lake plants;
        they were placed in a wagon built on purpose, and thus the sterlet lived
        twelve days, the lamprey eight, and both were alive when my cook seized
        them, killing one with milk and the other with wine. You do not believe
        me, M. Danglars!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I cannot help doubting,&rdquo; answered Danglars with his stupid
        smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Baptistin,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;have the other fish
        brought in&mdash;the sterlet and the lamprey which came in the other
        casks, and which are yet alive.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars opened his bewildered eyes; the company clapped their hands. Four
        servants carried in two casks covered with aquatic plants, and in each of which
        was breathing a fish similar to those on the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But why have two of each sort?&rdquo; asked Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Merely because one might have died,&rdquo; carelessly answered
        Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are certainly an extraordinary man,&rdquo; said Danglars;
        &ldquo;and philosophers may well say it is a fine thing to be rich.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And to have ideas,&rdquo; added Madame Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, do not give me credit for this, madame; it was done by the
        Romans, who much esteemed them, and Pliny relates that they sent slaves
        from Ostia to Rome, who carried on their heads fish which he calls the <i>mulus</i>,
        and which, from the description, must probably be the goldfish. It was
        also considered a luxury to have them alive, it being an amusing sight to
        see them die, for, when dying, they change color three or four times, and
        like the rainbow when it disappears, pass through all the prismatic
        shades, after which they were sent to the kitchen. Their agony formed part
        of their merit&mdash;if they were not seen alive, they were despised when
        dead.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Debray, &ldquo;but then Ostia is only a few
        leagues from Rome.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo; &ldquo;but what would be the use of
        living eighteen hundred years after Lucullus, if we can do no better than
        he could?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The two Cavalcanti opened their enormous eyes, but had the good sense not to
        say anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;All this is very extraordinary,&rdquo; said Château-Renaud; &ldquo;still,
        what I admire the most, I confess, is the marvellous promptitude with which your
        orders are executed. Is it not true that you only bought this house five or six
        days ago?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly not longer.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I am sure it is quite transformed since last week. If I
        remember rightly, it had another entrance, and the courtyard was paved and
        empty; while today we have a splendid lawn, bordered by trees which appear
        to be a hundred years old.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why not? I am fond of grass and shade,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Madame de Villefort, &ldquo;the door was towards
        the road before, and on the day of my miraculous escape you brought me
        into the house from the road, I remember.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, madame,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo; &ldquo;but I preferred
        having an entrance which would allow me to see the Bois de Boulogne over
        my gate.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In four days,&rdquo; said Morrel; &ldquo;it is extraordinary!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Château-Renaud, &ldquo;it seems quite
        miraculous to make a new house out of an old one; for it was very old, and
        dull too. I recollect coming for my mother to look at it when M. de
        Saint-Méran advertised it for sale two or three years ago.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. de Saint-Méran?&rdquo; said Madame de Villefort; &ldquo;then
        this house belonged to M. de Saint-Méran before you bought it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It appears so,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is it possible that you do not know of whom you purchased it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Quite so; my steward transacts all this business for me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is certainly ten years since the house had been occupied,&rdquo;
        said Château-Renaud, &ldquo;and it was quite melancholy to look at it,
        with the blinds closed, the doors locked, and the weeds in the court.
        Really, if the house had not belonged to the father-in-law of the
        procureur, one might have thought it some accursed place where a horrible
        crime had been committed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort, who had hitherto not tasted the three or four glasses of rare wine which
        were placed before him, here took one, and drank it off. Monte Cristo allowed a
        short time to elapse, and then said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is singular, baron, but the same idea came across me the first time I
        came here; it looked so gloomy I should never have bought it if my steward had not
        taken the matter into his own hands. Perhaps the fellow had been bribed by the
        notary.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is probable,&rdquo; stammered out Villefort, trying to smile;
        &ldquo;but I can assure you that I had nothing to do with any such
        proceeding. This house is part of Valentine&rsquo;s marriage-portion, and
        M. de Saint-Méran wished to sell it; for if it had remained another year
        or two uninhabited it would have fallen to ruin.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        It was Morrel&rsquo;s turn to become pale.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There was, above all, one room,&rdquo; continued Monte Cristo,
        &ldquo;very plain in appearance, hung with red damask, which, I know not
        why, appeared to me quite dramatic.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; said Danglars; &ldquo;why dramatic?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Can we account for instinct?&rdquo; said Monte Cristo. &ldquo;Are
        there not some places where we seem to breathe sadness?&mdash;why, we
        cannot tell. It is a chain of recollections&mdash;an idea which carries
        you back to other times, to other places&mdash;which, very likely, have no
        connection with the present time and place. And there is something in this
        room which reminds me forcibly of the chamber of the Marquise de
        Ganges<a href="#linknote-10" name="linknoteref-10" id="linknoteref-10">10</a> or
        Desdemona. Stay, since we have finished dinner, I will show it to
        you, and then we will take coffee in the garden. After dinner, the play.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo looked inquiringly at his guests. Madame de Villefort rose,
        Monte Cristo did the same, and the rest followed their example. Villefort
        and Madame Danglars remained for a moment, as if rooted to their seats;
        they questioned each other with vague and stupid glances.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you hear?&rdquo; said Madame Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We must go,&rdquo; replied Villefort, offering his arm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The others, attracted by curiosity, were already scattered in different parts of
        the house; for they thought the visit would not be limited to the one room,
        and that, at the same time, they would obtain a view of the rest of the
        building, of which Monte Cristo had created a palace. Each one went out by
        the open doors. Monte Cristo waited for the two who remained; then, when
        they had passed, he brought up the rear, and on his face was a smile,
        which, if they could have understood it, would have alarmed them much more
        than a visit to the room they were about to enter. They began by walking
        through the apartments, many of which were fitted up in the Eastern style,
        with cushions and divans instead of beds, and pipes instead of furniture.
        The drawing-rooms were decorated with the rarest pictures by the old
        masters, the boudoirs hung with draperies from China, of fanciful colors,
        fantastic design, and wonderful texture. At length they arrived at the
        famous room. There was nothing particular about it, excepting that,
        although daylight had disappeared, it was not lighted, and everything in
        it was old-fashioned, while the rest of the rooms had been redecorated.
        These two causes were enough to give it a gloomy aspect.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh.&rdquo; cried Madame de Villefort, &ldquo;it is really
        frightful.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Danglars tried to utter a few words, but was not heard. Many
        observations were made, the import of which was a unanimous opinion that
        there was something sinister about the room.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30221m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is it not so?&rdquo; asked Monte Cristo. &ldquo;Look at that large
        clumsy bed, hung with such gloomy, blood-colored drapery! And those two
        crayon portraits, that have faded from the dampness; do they not seem to
        say, with their pale lips and staring eyes, &lsquo;We have seen&rsquo;?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort became livid; Madame Danglars fell into a long seat placed near
        the chimney.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Madame de Villefort, smiling, &ldquo;are you courageous
        enough to sit down upon the very seat perhaps upon which the crime was
        committed?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Danglars rose suddenly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, &ldquo;this is not all.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is there more?&rdquo; said Debray, who had not failed to
        notice the agitation of Madame Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, what else is there?&rdquo; said Danglars; &ldquo;for, at
        present, I cannot say that I have seen anything extraordinary. What do you
        say, M. Cavalcanti?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we have at Pisa, Ugolino&rsquo;s tower;
        at Ferrara, Tasso&rsquo;s prison; at Rimini, the room of Francesca and
        Paolo.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but you have not this little staircase,&rdquo; said Monte
        Cristo, opening a door concealed by the drapery. &ldquo;Look at it, and
        tell me what you think of it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What a wicked-looking, crooked staircase,&rdquo; said
        Château-Renaud with a smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not know whether the wine of Chios produces melancholy, but
        certainly everything appears to me black in this house,&rdquo; said
        Debray.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ever since Valentine&rsquo;s dowry had been mentioned, Morrel had been
        silent and sad.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Can you imagine,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, &ldquo;some Othello or Abbé
        de Ganges, one stormy, dark night, descending these stairs step by step, carrying
        a load, which he wishes to hide from the sight of man, if not from God?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Danglars half fainted on the arm of Villefort, who was obliged to support
        himself against the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, madame,&rdquo; cried Debray, &ldquo;what is the matter with you? how
        pale you look!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is very evident what is the matter with her,&rdquo; said Madame
        de Villefort; &ldquo;M. de Monte Cristo is relating horrible stories to
        us, doubtless intending to frighten us to death.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Villefort, &ldquo;really, count, you frighten the
        ladies.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked Debray, in a whisper, of Madame
        Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she replied with a violent effort. &ldquo;I want
        air, that is all.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Will you come into the garden?&rdquo; said Debray, advancing
        towards the back staircase.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I would rather remain here.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you really frightened, madame?&rdquo; said Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, sir,&rdquo; said Madame Danglars; &ldquo;but you suppose
        scenes in a manner which gives them the appearance of reality.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30223m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo smiling; &ldquo;it is all a
        matter of imagination. Why should we not imagine this the apartment of an
        honest mother? And this bed with red hangings, a bed visited by the
        goddess Lucina? And that mysterious staircase, the passage through which,
        not to disturb their sleep, the doctor and nurse pass, or even the father
        carrying the sleeping child?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Here Madame Danglars, instead of being calmed by the soft picture, uttered a groan
        and fainted.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Madame Danglars is ill,&rdquo; said Villefort; &ldquo;it would be better
        to take her to her carriage.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, <i>mon Dieu!</i>&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, &ldquo;and I have
        forgotten my smelling-bottle!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have mine,&rdquo; said Madame de Villefort; and she passed over
        to Monte Cristo a bottle full of the same kind of red liquid whose good
        properties the count had tested on Edward.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, taking it from her hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;at your advice I have made the trial.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And have you succeeded?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Danglars was carried into the adjoining room; Monte Cristo dropped
        a very small portion of the red liquid upon her lips; she returned to
        consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;what a frightful dream!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort pressed her hand to let her know it was not a dream. They looked
        for M. Danglars, but, as he was not especially interested in poetical
        ideas, he had gone into the garden, and was talking with Major Cavalcanti
        on the projected railway from Leghorn to Florence. Monte Cristo seemed in
        despair. He took the arm of Madame Danglars, and conducted her into the
        garden, where they found Danglars taking coffee between the Cavalcanti.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Really, madame,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;did I alarm you much?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, sir,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;but you know, things
        impress us differently, according to the mood of our minds.&rdquo;
        Villefort forced a laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And then, you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an idea, a supposition, is
        sufficient.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, &ldquo;you may believe me if you
        like, but it is my opinion that a crime has been committed in this house.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; said Madame de Villefort, &ldquo;the king&rsquo;s
        attorney is here.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo, &ldquo;since that is the case, I
        will take advantage of his presence to make my declaration.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your declaration?&rdquo; said Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, before witnesses.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, this is very interesting,&rdquo; said Debray; &ldquo;if there
        really has been a crime, we will investigate it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There has been a crime,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo. &ldquo;Come this
        way, gentlemen; come, M. Villefort, for a declaration to be available,
        should be made before the competent authorities.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He then took Villefort&rsquo;s arm, and, at the same time, holding that of Madame
        Danglars under his own, he dragged the procureur to the plantain-tree,
        where the shade was thickest. All the other guests followed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Stay,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, &ldquo;here, in this very spot&rdquo;
        (and he stamped upon the ground), &ldquo;I had the earth dug up and fresh mould
        put in, to refresh these old trees; well, my man, digging, found a box, or rather,
        the iron-work of a box, in the midst of which was the skeleton of a newly
        born infant.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30225m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo felt the arm of Madame Danglars stiffen, while that of Villefort
        trembled.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A newly born infant,&rdquo; repeated Debray; &ldquo;this affair becomes
        serious!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Château-Renaud, &ldquo;I was not wrong just now
        then, when I said that houses had souls and faces like men, and that their
        exteriors carried the impress of their characters. This house was gloomy
        because it was remorseful: it was remorseful because it concealed a crime.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Who said it was a crime?&rdquo; asked Villefort, with a last
        effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How? is it not a crime to bury a living child in a garden?&rdquo;
        cried Monte Cristo. &ldquo;And pray what do you call such an action?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But who said it was buried alive?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why bury it there if it were dead? This garden has never been a
        cemetery.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is done to infanticides in this country?&rdquo; asked Major
        Cavalcanti innocently.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, their heads are soon cut off,&rdquo; said Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, indeed?&rdquo; said Cavalcanti.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I think so; am I not right, M. de Villefort?&rdquo; asked Monte
        Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, count,&rdquo; replied Villefort, in a voice now scarcely
        human.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo, seeing that the two persons for whom he had prepared this
        scene could scarcely endure it, and not wishing to carry it too far, said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, gentlemen,&mdash;some coffee, we seem to have forgotten it,&rdquo;
        and he conducted the guests back to the table on the lawn.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed, count,&rdquo; said Madame Danglars, &ldquo;I am ashamed to
        own it, but all your frightful stories have so upset me, that I must beg
        you to let me sit down;&rdquo; and she fell into a chair.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo bowed, and went to Madame de Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I think Madame Danglars again requires your bottle,&rdquo; he said. But
        before Madame de Villefort could reach her friend, the procureur had found time to
        whisper to Madame Danglars, &ldquo;I must speak to you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;When?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Tomorrow.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In my office, or in the court, if you like,&mdash;that is the
        surest place.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will be there.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment Madame de Villefort approached.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thanks, my dear friend,&rdquo; said Madame Danglars, trying to
        smile; &ldquo;it is over now, and I am much better.&rdquo;
