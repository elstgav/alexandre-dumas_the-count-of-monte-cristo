      <h2>Chapter 46. Unlimited Credit</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>bout two o&rsquo;clock
        the following day a calash, drawn by a pair of magnificent English horses,
        stopped at the door of Monte Cristo and a person, dressed in a blue coat,
        with buttons of a similar color, a white waistcoat, over which was
        displayed a massive gold chain, brown trousers, and a quantity of black
        hair descending so low over his eyebrows as to leave it doubtful whether
        it were not artificial so little did its jetty glossiness assimilate with
        the deep wrinkles stamped on his features&mdash;a person, in a word, who,
        although evidently past fifty, desired to be taken for not more than
        forty, bent forwards from the carriage door, on the panels of which were
        emblazoned the armorial bearings of a baron, and directed his groom to
        inquire at the porter&rsquo;s lodge whether the Count of Monte Cristo
        resided there, and if he were within.
      </p>
      <p>
        While waiting, the occupant of the carriage surveyed the house, the garden as far
        as he could distinguish it, and the livery of servants who passed to and fro, with
        an attention so close as to be somewhat impertinent. His glance was keen but
        showed cunning rather than intelligence; his lips were straight, and so thin
        that, as they closed, they were drawn in over the teeth; his cheek-bones
        were broad and projecting, a never-failing proof of audacity and
        craftiness; while the flatness of his forehead, and the enlargement of the
        back of his skull, which rose much higher than his large and coarsely
        shaped ears, combined to form a physiognomy anything but prepossessing,
        save in the eyes of such as considered that the owner of so splendid an
        equipage must needs be all that was admirable and enviable, more
        especially when they gazed on the enormous diamond that glittered in his
        shirt, and the red ribbon that depended from his button-hole.
      </p>
      <p>
        The groom, in obedience to his orders, tapped at the window of the porter&rsquo;s
        lodge, saying:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Pray, does not the Count of Monte Cristo live here?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;His excellency does reside here,&rdquo; replied the concierge;
        &ldquo;but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; added he, glancing an inquiring look at
        Ali. Ali returned a sign in the negative.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But what?&rdquo; asked the groom.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;His excellency does not receive visitors today.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then here is my master&rsquo;s card, the Baron Danglars. You
        will take it to the count, and say that, although in haste to attend the
        Chamber, my master came out of his way to have the honor of calling upon
        him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I never speak to his excellency,&rdquo; replied the concierge;
        &ldquo;the valet de chambre will carry your message.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The groom returned to the carriage.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        The man, somewhat crest-fallen by the rebuke he had received, repeated what the
        concierge had said.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bless me,&rdquo; murmured Baron Danglars, &ldquo;this must surely be a
        prince instead of a count by their styling him &lsquo;excellency,&rsquo; and only
        venturing to address him by the medium of his valet de chambre. However, it does
        not signify; he has a letter of credit on me, so I must see him when he requires
        his money.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, throwing himself back in his carriage, Danglars called out to his
        coachman, in a voice that might be heard across the road, &ldquo;To the
        Chamber of Deputies.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Apprised in time of the visit paid him, Monte Cristo had, from behind the
        blinds of his pavilion, as minutely observed the baron, by means of an
        excellent lorgnette, as Danglars himself had scrutinized the house,
        garden, and servants.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That fellow has a decidedly bad countenance,&rdquo; said the count in a
        tone of disgust, as he shut up his glass into its ivory case. &ldquo;How comes it
        that all do not retreat in aversion at sight of that flat, receding, serpent-like
        forehead, round, vulture-shaped head, and sharp-hooked nose, like the beak of a
        buzzard? Ali,&rdquo; cried he, striking at the same time on the brazen gong. Ali
        appeared. &ldquo;Summon Bertuccio,&rdquo; said the count. Almost immediately
        Bertuccio entered the apartment.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did your excellency desire to see me?&rdquo; inquired he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I did,&rdquo; replied the count. &ldquo;You no doubt observed the horses
        standing a few minutes since at the door?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly, your excellency. I noticed them for their remarkable
        beauty.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then how comes it,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo with a frown, &ldquo;that,
        when I desired you to purchase for me the finest pair of horses to be
        found in Paris, there is another pair, fully as fine as mine, not in my
        stables?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At the look of displeasure, added to the angry tone in which the count spoke, Ali
        turned pale and held down his head.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is not your fault, my good Ali,&rdquo; said the count in the Arabic
        language, and with a gentleness none would have thought him capable of showing,
        either in voice or face&mdash;&ldquo;it is not your fault. You do not understand
        the points of English horses.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The countenance of poor Ali recovered its serenity.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Permit me to assure your excellency,&rdquo; said Bertuccio, &ldquo;that the
        horses you speak of were not to be sold when I purchased yours.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;It seems, sir steward,&rdquo; said he,
        &ldquo;that you have yet to learn that all things are to be sold to such as care
        to pay the price.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;His excellency is not, perhaps, aware that M. Danglars gave 16,000
        francs for his horses?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well. Then offer him double that sum; a banker never loses an
        opportunity of doubling his capital.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is your excellency really in earnest?&rdquo; inquired the steward.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo regarded the person who durst presume to doubt his words with
        the look of one equally surprised and displeased.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have to pay a visit this evening,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;I desire that
        these horses, with completely new harness, may be at the door with my carriage.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Bertuccio bowed, and was about to retire; but when he reached the door, he
        paused, and then said, &ldquo;At what o&rsquo;clock does your excellency
        wish the carriage and horses to be ready?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At five o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; replied the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I beg your excellency&rsquo;s pardon,&rdquo; interposed the steward
        in a deprecating manner, &ldquo;for venturing to observe that it is
        already two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am perfectly aware of that fact,&rdquo; answered Monte Cristo
        calmly. Then, turning towards Ali, he said, &ldquo;Let all the horses in
        my stables be led before the windows of your young lady, that she may
        select those she prefers for her carriage. Request her also to oblige me
        by saying whether it is her pleasure to dine with me; if so, let dinner be
        served in her apartments. Now, leave me, and desire my valet de chambre to
        come hither.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Scarcely had Ali disappeared when the valet entered the chamber.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Monsieur Baptistin,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;you have been in my
        service one year, the time I generally give myself to judge of the merits or
        demerits of those about me. You suit me very well.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Baptistin bowed low.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It only remains for me to know whether I also suit you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, your excellency!&rdquo; exclaimed Baptistin eagerly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen, if you please, till I have finished speaking,&rdquo;
        replied Monte Cristo. &ldquo;You receive 1,500 francs per annum for your
        services here&mdash;more than many a brave subaltern, who continually
        risks his life for his country, obtains. You live in a manner far superior
        to many clerks who work ten times harder than you do for their money.
        Then, though yourself a servant, you have other servants to wait upon you,
        take care of your clothes, and see that your linen is duly prepared for
        you. Again, you make a profit upon each article you purchase for my
        toilet, amounting in the course of a year to a sum equalling your wages.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nay, indeed, your excellency.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am not condemning you for this, Monsieur Baptistin; but let your
        profits end here. It would be long indeed ere you would find so lucrative
        a post as that you have now the good fortune to fill. I neither ill-use
        nor ill-treat my servants by word or action. An error I readily forgive,
        but wilful negligence or forgetfulness, never. My commands are ordinarily
        short, clear, and precise; and I would rather be obliged to repeat my
        words twice, or even three times, than they should be misunderstood. I am
        rich enough to know whatever I desire to know, and I can promise you I am
        not wanting in curiosity. If, then, I should learn that you had taken upon
        yourself to speak of me to anyone favorably or unfavorably, to comment on
        my actions, or watch my conduct, that very instant you would quit my
        service. You may now retire. I never caution my servants a second
        time&mdash;remember that.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Baptistin bowed, and was proceeding towards the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I forgot to mention to you,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;that I lay yearly
        aside a certain sum for each servant in my establishment; those whom I am
        compelled to dismiss lose (as a matter of course) all participation in
        this money, while their portion goes to the fund accumulating for those
        domestics who remain with me, and among whom it will be divided at my
        death. You have been in my service a year, your fund has already begun to
        accumulate&mdash;let it continue to do so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        This address, delivered in the presence of Ali, who, not understanding one
        word of the language in which it was spoken, stood wholly unmoved,
        produced an effect on M. Baptistin only to be conceived by such as have
        occasion to study the character and disposition of French domestics.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I assure your excellency,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that at least it
        shall be my study to merit your approbation in all things, and I will take
        M. Ali as my model.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; replied the count in the most frigid tones;
        &ldquo;Ali has many faults mixed with most excellent qualities. He cannot
        possibly serve you as a pattern for your conduct, not being, as you are, a
        paid servant, but a mere slave&mdash;a dog, who, should he fail in his
        duty towards me, I should not discharge from my service, but kill.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Baptistin opened his eyes with astonishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You seem incredulous,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, who repeated to Ali
        in the Arabic language what he had just been saying to Baptistin in
        French.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Nubian smiled assentingly to his master&rsquo;s words, then, kneeling on one
        knee, respectfully kissed the hand of the count. This corroboration of the lesson
        he had just received put the finishing stroke to the wonder and stupefaction of
        M. Baptistin. The count then motioned the valet de chambre to retire, and to Ali
        to follow to his study, where they conversed long and earnestly together. As the
        hand of the clock pointed to five the count struck thrice upon his gong. When Ali
        was wanted one stroke was given, two summoned Baptistin, and three Bertuccio. The
        steward entered.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My horses,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They are at the door harnessed to the carriage as your excellency
        desired. Does your excellency wish me to accompany him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, the coachman, Ali, and Baptistin will go.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The count descended to the door of his mansion, and beheld his carriage drawn by
        the very pair of horses he had so much admired in the morning as the property
        of Danglars. As he passed them he said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They are extremely handsome certainly, and you have done well to purchase
        them, although you were somewhat remiss not to have procured them sooner.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed, your excellency, I had very considerable difficulty in
        obtaining them, and, as it is, they have cost an enormous price.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Does the sum you gave for them make the animals less beautiful,&rdquo;
        inquired the count, shrugging his shoulders.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nay, if your excellency is satisfied, it is all that I could wish.
        Whither does your excellency desire to be driven?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To the residence of Baron Danglars, Rue de la Chaussée d&rsquo;Antin.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        This conversation had passed as they stood upon the terrace, from which a
        flight of stone steps led to the carriage-drive. As Bertuccio, with a
        respectful bow, was moving away, the count called him back.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have another commission for you, M. Bertuccio,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I
        am desirous of having an estate by the seaside in Normandy&mdash;for
        instance, between Le Havre and Boulogne. You see I give you a wide range.
        It will be absolutely necessary that the place you may select have a small
        harbor, creek, or bay, into which my corvette can enter and remain at
        anchor. She draws only fifteen feet. She must be kept in constant
        readiness to sail immediately I think proper to give the signal. Make the
        requisite inquiries for a place of this description, and when you have met
        with an eligible spot, visit it, and if it possess the advantages desired,
        purchase it at once in your own name. The corvette must now, I think, be
        on her way to Fécamp, must she not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20333m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly, your excellency; I saw her put to sea the same evening
        we quitted Marseilles.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And the yacht.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Was ordered to remain at Martigues.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well. I wish you to write from time to time to the
        captains in charge of the two vessels so as to keep them on the alert.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And the steamboat?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;She is at Châlons?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The same orders for her as for the two sailing vessels.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very good.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;When you have purchased the estate I desire, I want constant relays
        of horses at ten leagues apart along the northern and southern road.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your excellency may depend upon me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The Count made a gesture of satisfaction, descended the terrace steps, and sprang
        into his carriage, which was whirled along swiftly to the banker&rsquo;s house.
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars was engaged at that moment, presiding over a railroad committee.
        But the meeting was nearly concluded when the name of his visitor was
        announced. As the count&rsquo;s title sounded on his ear he rose, and
        addressing his colleagues, who were members of one or the other Chamber,
        he said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Gentlemen, pardon me for leaving you so abruptly; but a most ridiculous
        circumstance has occurred, which is this,&mdash;Thomson &amp; French, the Roman
        bankers, have sent to me a certain person calling himself the Count of Monte
        Cristo, and have given him an unlimited credit with me. I confess this is the
        drollest thing I have ever met with in the course of my extensive foreign
        transactions, and you may readily suppose it has greatly roused my curiosity. I
        took the trouble this morning to call on the pretended count&mdash;if he were a
        real count he wouldn&rsquo;t be so rich. But, would you believe it, &lsquo;He was
        not receiving.&rsquo; So the master of Monte Cristo gives himself airs befitting a
        great millionaire or a capricious beauty. I made inquiries, and found that the
        house in the Champs-Élysées is his own property, and certainly it was very
        decently kept up. But,&rdquo; pursued Danglars with one of his sinister
        smiles, &ldquo;an order for unlimited credit calls for something like
        caution on the part of the banker to whom that order is given. I am very
        anxious to see this man. I suspect a hoax is intended, but the instigators
        of it little knew whom they had to deal with. &lsquo;They laugh best who
        laugh last!&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Having delivered himself of this pompous address, uttered with a degree of
        energy that left the baron almost out of breath, he bowed to the assembled
        party and withdrew to his drawing-room, whose sumptuous furnishings of
        white and gold had caused a great sensation in the Chaussée d&rsquo;Antin.
        It was to this apartment he had desired his guest to be shown, with the
        purpose of overwhelming him at the sight of so much luxury. He found the
        count standing before some copies of Albano and Fattore that had been
        passed off to the banker as originals; but which, mere copies as they
        were, seemed to feel their degradation in being brought into juxtaposition
        with the gaudy colors that covered the ceiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        The count turned round as he heard the entrance of Danglars into the room. With a
        slight inclination of the head, Danglars signed to the count to be seated, pointing
        significantly to a gilded armchair, covered with white satin embroidered
        with gold. The count sat down.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20335m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have the honor, I presume, of addressing M. de Monte Cristo.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The count bowed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And I of speaking to Baron Danglars, chevalier of the Legion of Honor,
        and member of the Chamber of Deputies?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo repeated all the titles he had read on the baron&rsquo;s
        card.
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars felt the irony and compressed his lips.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You will, I trust, excuse me, monsieur, for not calling you by your title
        when I first addressed you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but you are aware that we are
        living under a popular form of government, and that I am myself a representative
        of the liberties of the people.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So much so,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo, &ldquo;that while you call
        yourself baron you are not willing to call anybody else count.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Upon my word, monsieur,&rdquo; said Danglars with affected
        carelessness, &ldquo;I attach no sort of value to such empty distinctions;
        but the fact is, I was made baron, and also chevalier of the Legion of
        Honor, in return for services rendered, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But you have discarded your titles after the example set you by
        Messrs. de Montmorency and Lafayette? That was a noble example to follow,
        monsieur.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied Danglars, &ldquo;not entirely so; with the
        servants,&mdash;you understand.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I see; to your domestics you are &lsquo;my lord,&rsquo; the
        journalists style you &lsquo;monsieur,&rsquo; while your constituents call
        you &lsquo;citizen.&rsquo; These are distinctions very suitable under a
        constitutional government. I understand perfectly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Again Danglars bit his lips; he saw that he was no match for Monte Cristo in an
        argument of this sort, and he therefore hastened to turn to subjects more
        congenial.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Permit me to inform you, Count,&rdquo; said he, bowing, &ldquo;that
        I have received a letter of advice from Thomson &amp; French, of Rome.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am glad to hear it, baron,&mdash;for I must claim the privilege
        of addressing you after the manner of your servants. I have acquired the
        bad habit of calling persons by their titles from living in a country
        where barons are still barons by right of birth. But as regards the letter
        of advice, I am charmed to find that it has reached you; that will spare
        me the troublesome and disagreeable task of coming to you for money
        myself. You have received a regular letter of advice?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Danglars, &ldquo;but I confess I didn&rsquo;t
        quite comprehend its meaning.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And for that reason I did myself the honor of calling upon you, in
        order to beg for an explanation.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Go on, monsieur. Here I am, ready to give you any explanation you
        desire.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Danglars, &ldquo;in the letter&mdash;I believe I
        have it about me&rdquo;&mdash;here he felt in his breast-pocket&mdash;&ldquo;yes,
        here it is. Well, this letter gives the Count of Monte Cristo unlimited
        credit on our house.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, baron, what is there difficult to understand about that?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Merely the term <i>unlimited</i>&mdash;nothing else, certainly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is not that word known in France? The people who wrote are
        Anglo-Germans, you know.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, as for the composition of the letter, there is nothing to be
        said; but as regards the competency of the document, I certainly have
        doubts.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; asked the count, assuming all air and tone
        of the utmost simplicity and candor. &ldquo;Is it possible that Thomson
        &amp; French are not looked upon as safe and solvent bankers? Pray tell me
        what you think, baron, for I feel uneasy, I can assure you, having some
        considerable property in their hands.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thomson &amp; French are perfectly solvent,&rdquo; replied
        Danglars, with an almost mocking smile; &ldquo;but the word <i>unlimited</i>,
        in financial affairs, is so extremely vague.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is, in fact, unlimited,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Precisely what I was about to say,&rdquo; cried Danglars. &ldquo;Now
        what is vague is doubtful; and it was a wise man who said, &lsquo;when in
        doubt, keep out.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Meaning to say,&rdquo; rejoined Monte Cristo, &ldquo;that however
        Thomson &amp; French may be inclined to commit acts of imprudence and
        folly, the Baron Danglars is not disposed to follow their example.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Plainly enough; Messrs. Thomson &amp; French set no bounds to their
        engagements while those of M. Danglars have their limits; he is a wise
        man, according to his own showing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; replied the banker, drawing himself up with a
        haughty air, &ldquo;the extent of my resources has never yet been
        questioned.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It seems, then, reserved for me,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo coldly,
        &ldquo;to be the first to do so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By what right, sir?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By right of the objections you have raised, and the explanations
        you have demanded, which certainly must have some motive.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Once more Danglars bit his lips. It was the second time he had been
        worsted, and this time on his own ground. His forced politeness sat
        awkwardly upon him, and approached almost to impertinence. Monte Cristo on
        the contrary, preserved a graceful suavity of demeanor, aided by a certain
        degree of simplicity he could assume at pleasure, and thus possessed the
        advantage.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; resumed Danglars, after a brief silence, &ldquo;I
        will endeavor to make myself understood, by requesting you to inform me
        for what sum you propose to draw upon me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, truly,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo, determined not to lose an
        inch of the ground he had gained, &ldquo;my reason for desiring an &lsquo;unlimited&rsquo;
        credit was precisely because I did not know how much money I might need.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The banker thought the time had come for him to take the upper hand. So
        throwing himself back in his armchair, he said, with an arrogant and
        purse-proud air:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let me beg of you not to hesitate in naming your wishes; you will then be
        convinced that the resources of the house of Danglars, however limited, are still
        equal to meeting the largest demands; and were you even to require
        a million&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; interposed Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I said a million,&rdquo; replied Danglars, with the confidence of
        ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But could I do with a million?&rdquo; retorted the count. &ldquo;My
        dear sir, if a trifle like that could suffice me, I should never have
        given myself the trouble of opening an account. A million? Excuse my
        smiling when you speak of a sum I am in the habit of carrying in my
        pocket-book or dressing-case.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And with these words Monte Cristo took from his pocket a small case containing his
        visiting-cards, and drew forth two orders on the treasury for 500,000 francs each,
        payable at sight to the bearer. A man like Danglars was wholly inaccessible to any
        gentler method of correction. The effect of the present revelation was stunning;
        he trembled and was on the verge of apoplexy. The pupils of his eyes, as
        he gazed at Monte Cristo dilated horribly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, &ldquo;confess honestly that
        you have not perfect confidence in Thomson &amp; French. I understand, and
        foreseeing that such might be the case, I took, in spite of my ignorance
        of affairs, certain precautions. See, here are two similar letters to that
        you have yourself received; one from the house of Arstein &amp; Eskeles of
        Vienna, to Baron Rothschild, the other drawn by Baring of London, upon M.
        Lafitte. Now, sir, you have but to say the word, and I will spare you all
        uneasiness by presenting my letter of credit to one or other of these two
        firms.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The blow had struck home, and Danglars was entirely vanquished; with a trembling
        hand he took the two letters from the count, who held them carelessly between
        finger and thumb, and proceeded to scrutinize the signatures, with a minuteness
        that the count might have regarded as insulting, had it not suited his present
        purpose to mislead the banker.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, sir,&rdquo; said Danglars, after he had convinced himself of the
        authenticity of the documents he held, and rising as if to salute the power of
        gold personified in the man before him,&mdash;&ldquo;three letters of unlimited
        credit! I can be no longer mistrustful, but you must pardon me, my dear count,
        for confessing to some degree of astonishment.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; answered Monte Cristo, with the most gentlemanly air,
        &ldquo;&rsquo;tis not for such trifling sums as these that your banking
        house is to be incommoded. Then, you can let me have some money, can you
        not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Whatever you say, my dear count; I am at your orders.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo, &ldquo;since we mutually
        understand each other&mdash;for such I presume is the case?&rdquo;
        Danglars bowed assentingly. &ldquo;You are quite sure that not a lurking
        doubt or suspicion lingers in your mind?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, my dear count,&rdquo; exclaimed Danglars, &ldquo;I never for an
        instant entertained such a feeling towards you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, you merely wished to be convinced, nothing more; but now that
        we have come to so clear an understanding, and that all distrust and
        suspicion are laid at rest, we may as well fix a sum as the probable
        expenditure of the first year, suppose we say six millions to&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Six millions!&rdquo; gasped Danglars&mdash;&ldquo;so be it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then, if I should require more,&rdquo; continued Monte Cristo in a
        careless manner, &ldquo;why, of course, I should draw upon you; but my
        present intention is not to remain in France more than a year, and during
        that period I scarcely think I shall exceed the sum I mentioned. However,
        we shall see. Be kind enough, then, to send me 500,000 francs tomorrow. I
        shall be at home till midday, or if not, I will leave a receipt with my
        steward.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The money you desire shall be at your house by ten o&rsquo;clock
        tomorrow morning, my dear count,&rdquo; replied Danglars. &ldquo;How would
        you like to have it? in gold, silver, or notes?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Half in gold, and the other half in bank-notes, if you please,&rdquo;
        said the count, rising from his seat.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I must confess to you, count,&rdquo; said Danglars, &ldquo;that I
        have hitherto imagined myself acquainted with the degree of all the great
        fortunes of Europe, and still wealth such as yours has been wholly unknown
        to me. May I presume to ask whether you have long possessed it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It has been in the family a very long while,&rdquo; returned Monte
        Cristo, &ldquo;a sort of treasure expressly forbidden to be touched for a
        certain period of years, during which the accumulated interest has doubled
        the capital. The period appointed by the testator for the disposal of
        these riches occurred only a short time ago, and they have only been
        employed by me within the last few years. Your ignorance on the subject,
        therefore, is easily accounted for. However, you will be better informed
        as to me and my possessions ere long.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And the count, while pronouncing these latter words, accompanied them with one of
        those ghastly smiles that used to strike terror into poor Franz d&rsquo;Épinay.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With your tastes, and means of gratifying them,&rdquo; continued
        Danglars, &ldquo;you will exhibit a splendor that must effectually put us
        poor miserable millionaires quite in the shade. If I mistake not you are
        an admirer of paintings, at least I judged so from the attention you
        appeared to be bestowing on mine when I entered the room. If you will
        permit me, I shall be happy to show you my picture gallery, composed
        entirely of works by the ancient masters&mdash;warranted as such. Not a
        modern picture among them. I cannot endure the modern school of painting.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are perfectly right in objecting to them, for this one great
        fault&mdash;that they have not yet had time to become old.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Or will you allow me to show you several fine statues by
        Thorwaldsen, Bartoloni, and Canova?&mdash;all foreign artists, for, as you
        may perceive, I think but very indifferently of our French sculptors.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have a right to be unjust to them, monsieur; they are your
        compatriots.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But all this may come later, when we shall be better known to each
        other. For the present, I will confine myself (if perfectly agreeable to
        you) to introducing you to the Baroness Danglars&mdash;excuse my
        impatience, my dear count, but a client like you is almost like a member
        of the family.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo bowed, in sign that he accepted the proffered honor; Danglars rang
        and was answered by a servant in a showy livery.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is the baroness at home?&rdquo; inquired Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, my lord,&rdquo; answered the man.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And alone?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, my lord, madame has visitors.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you any objection to meet any persons who may be with madame,
        or do you desire to preserve a strict <i>incognito</i>?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo with a smile, &ldquo;I do
        not arrogate to myself the right of so doing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And who is with madame?&mdash;M. Debray?&rdquo; inquired Danglars,
        with an air of indulgence and good-nature that made Monte Cristo smile,
        acquainted as he was with the secrets of the banker&rsquo;s domestic life.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, my lord,&rdquo; replied the servant, &ldquo;M. Debray is with
        madame.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars nodded his head; then, turning to Monte Cristo, said, &ldquo;M. Lucien
        Debray is an old friend of ours, and private secretary to the Minister of the
        Interior. As for my wife, I must tell you, she lowered herself by marrying me, for
        she belongs to one of the most ancient families in France. Her maiden name was De
        Servières, and her first husband was Colonel the Marquis of Nargonne.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have not the honor of knowing Madame Danglars; but I have already
        met M. Lucien Debray.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, indeed?&rdquo; said Danglars; &ldquo;and where was that?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At the house of M. de Morcerf.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah! you are acquainted with the young viscount, are you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We were together a good deal during the Carnival at Rome.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;True, true,&rdquo; cried Danglars. &ldquo;Let me see; have I not
        heard talk of some strange adventure with bandits or thieves hid in ruins,
        and of his having had a miraculous escape? I forget how, but I know he
        used to amuse my wife and daughter by telling them about it after his
        return from Italy.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Her ladyship is waiting to receive you, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the
        servant, who had gone to inquire the pleasure of his mistress.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With your permission,&rdquo; said Danglars, bowing, &ldquo;I will precede
        you, to show you the way.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo; &ldquo;I follow you.&rdquo;
