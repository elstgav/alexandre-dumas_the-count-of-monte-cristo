      <h2>Chapter 107. The Lions&rsquo; Den</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ne division of La
        Force, in which the most dangerous and desperate prisoners are confined,
        is called the court of Saint-Bernard. The prisoners, in their expressive
        language, have named it the &ldquo;Lions&rsquo; Den,&rdquo; probably
        because the captives possess teeth which frequently gnaw the bars, and
        sometimes the keepers also. It is a prison within a prison; the walls are
        double the thickness of the rest. The gratings are every day carefully
        examined by jailers, whose herculean proportions and cold pitiless
        expression prove them to have been chosen to reign over their subjects for
        their superior activity and intelligence.
      </p>
      <p>
        The courtyard of this quarter is enclosed by enormous walls, over which the sun
        glances obliquely, when it deigns to penetrate into this gulf of moral and
        physical deformity. On this paved yard are to be seen,&mdash;pacing to and
        fro from morning till night, pale, careworn, and haggard, like so many
        shadows,&mdash;the men whom justice holds beneath the steel she is sharpening.
        There, crouched against the side of the wall which attracts and retains the most
        heat, they may be seen sometimes talking to one another, but more frequently
        alone, watching the door, which sometimes opens to call forth one from the
        gloomy assemblage, or to throw in another outcast from society.
      </p>
      <p>
        The court of Saint-Bernard has its own particular apartment for the
        reception of guests; it is a long rectangle, divided by two upright
        gratings placed at a distance of three feet from one another to prevent a
        visitor from shaking hands with or passing anything to the prisoners. It
        is a wretched, damp, nay, even horrible spot, more especially when we
        consider the agonizing conferences which have taken place between those
        iron bars. And yet, frightful though this spot may be, it is looked upon
        as a kind of paradise by the men whose days are numbered; it is so rare
        for them to leave the Lions&rsquo; Den for any other place than the
        barrier Saint-Jacques, the galleys! or solitary confinement.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the court which we have attempted to describe, and from which a damp
        vapor was rising, a young man with his hands in his pockets, who had
        excited much curiosity among the inhabitants of the &ldquo;Den,&rdquo;
        might be seen walking. The cut of his clothes would have made him pass for
        an elegant man, if those clothes had not been torn to shreds; still they
        did not show signs of wear, and the fine cloth, beneath the careful hands
        of the prisoner, soon recovered its gloss in the parts which were still
        perfect, for the wearer tried his best to make it assume the appearance of
        a new coat. He bestowed the same attention upon the cambric front of a
        shirt, which had considerably changed in color since his entrance into the
        prison, and he polished his varnished boots with the corner of a
        handkerchief embroidered with initials surmounted by a coronet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the inmates of the &ldquo;Lions&rsquo; Den&rdquo; were watching the
        operations of the prisoner&rsquo;s toilet with considerable interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;See, the prince is pluming himself,&rdquo; said one of the thieves.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fine looking fellow,&rdquo; said another; &ldquo;if he
        had only a comb and hair-grease, he&rsquo;d take the shine off the
        gentlemen in white kids.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;His coat looks almost new, and his boots shine like a nigger&rsquo;s
        face. It&rsquo;s pleasant to have such well-dressed comrades; but didn&rsquo;t
        those gendarmes behave shameful?&mdash;must &rsquo;a been jealous, to tear
        such clothes!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He looks like a big-bug,&rdquo; said another; &ldquo;dresses in
        fine style. And, then, to be here so young! Oh, what larks!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile the object of this hideous admiration approached the wicket,
        against which one of the keepers was leaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;lend me twenty francs; you will soon be
        paid; you run no risks with me. Remember, I have relations who possess more
        millions than you have deniers. Come, I beseech you, lend me twenty francs, so
        that I may buy a dressing-gown; it is intolerable always to be in a coat and
        boots! And what a coat, sir, for a prince of the Cavalcanti!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The keeper turned his back, and shrugged his shoulders; he did not even laugh
        at what would have caused anyone else to do so; he had heard so many utter
        the same things,&mdash;indeed, he heard nothing else.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Andrea, &ldquo;you are a man void of compassion;
        I&rsquo;ll have you turned out.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        This made the keeper turn around, and he burst into a loud laugh. The prisoners
        then approached and formed a circle.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I tell you that with that wretched sum,&rdquo; continued Andrea, &ldquo;I
        could obtain a coat, and a room in which to receive the illustrious visitor I
        am daily expecting.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course&mdash;of course,&rdquo; said the prisoners;&mdash;&ldquo;anyone
        can see he&rsquo;s a gentleman!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, lend him the twenty francs,&rdquo; said the keeper,
        leaning on the other shoulder; &ldquo;surely you will not refuse a
        comrade!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50151m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am no comrade of these people,&rdquo; said the young man,
        proudly, &ldquo;you have no right to insult me thus.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The thieves looked at one another with low murmurs, and a storm gathered
        over the head of the aristocratic prisoner, raised less by his own words
        than by the manner of the keeper. The latter, sure of quelling the tempest
        when the waves became too violent, allowed them to rise to a certain pitch
        that he might be revenged on the importunate Andrea, and besides it would
        afford him some recreation during the long day.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thieves had already approached Andrea, some screaming, <i>&ldquo;La savate&mdash;La
        savate!&rdquo;</i><a href="#linknote-26" name="linknoteref-26" id="linknoteref-26">26</a>
        a cruel operation, which consists in cuffing a comrade who may have
        fallen into disgrace, not with an old shoe, but with an iron-heeled one.
        Others proposed the <i>anguille</i>, another kind of recreation, in which
        a handkerchief is filled with sand, pebbles, and two-sous pieces, when
        they have them, which the wretches beat like a flail over the head and
        shoulders of the unhappy sufferer.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us horsewhip the fine gentleman!&rdquo; said others.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Andrea, turning towards them, winked his eyes, rolled his tongue
        around his cheeks, and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a
        hundred words among the bandits when forced to be silent. It was a Masonic
        sign Caderousse had taught him. He was immediately recognized as one of
        them; the handkerchief was thrown down, and the iron-heeled shoe replaced
        on the foot of the wretch to whom it belonged.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some voices were heard to say that the gentleman was right; that he intended
        to be civil, in his way, and that they would set the example of liberty of
        conscience,&mdash;and the mob retired. The keeper was so stupefied at this
        scene that he took Andrea by the hands and began examining his person, attributing
        the sudden submission of the inmates of the Lions&rsquo; Den to something more
        substantial than mere fascination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Andrea made no resistance, although he protested against it. Suddenly a voice
        was heard at the wicket.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Benedetto!&rdquo; exclaimed an inspector. The keeper relaxed his hold.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am called,&rdquo; said Andrea.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To the visitors&rsquo; room!&rdquo; said the same voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You see someone pays me a visit. Ah, my dear sir, you will see
        whether a Cavalcanti is to be treated like a common person!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And Andrea, gliding through the court like a black shadow, rushed out through
        the wicket, leaving his comrades, and even the keeper, lost in wonder.
        Certainly a call to the visitors&rsquo; room had scarcely astonished
        Andrea less than themselves, for the wily youth, instead of making use of
        his privilege of waiting to be claimed on his entry into La Force, had
        maintained a rigid silence.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50153m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;proves me to be under the protection of
        some powerful person,&mdash;this sudden fortune, the facility with which I have
        overcome all obstacles, an unexpected family and an illustrious name awarded to
        me, gold showered down upon me, and the most splendid alliances about to be entered
        into. An unhappy lapse of fortune and the absence of my protector have cast me
        down, certainly, but not forever. The hand which has retreated for a while
        will be again stretched forth to save me at the very moment when I shall
        think myself sinking into the abyss. Why should I risk an imprudent step?
        It might alienate my protector. He has two means of extricating me from
        this dilemma,&mdash;the one by a mysterious escape, managed through
        bribery; the other by buying off my judges with gold. I will say and do
        nothing until I am convinced that he has quite abandoned me, and then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Andrea had formed a plan which was tolerably clever. The unfortunate youth
        was intrepid in the attack, and rude in the defence. He had borne with the
        public prison, and with privations of all sorts; still, by degrees nature,
        or rather custom, had prevailed, and he suffered from being naked, dirty,
        and hungry. It was at this moment of discomfort that the inspector&rsquo;s
        voice called him to the visiting-room. Andrea felt his heart leap with
        joy. It was too soon for a visit from the examining magistrate, and too
        late for one from the director of the prison, or the doctor; it must,
        then, be the visitor he hoped for. Behind the grating of the room into
        which Andrea had been led, he saw, while his eyes dilated with surprise,
        the dark and intelligent face of M. Bertuccio, who was also gazing with
        sad astonishment upon the iron bars, the bolted doors, and the shadow
        which moved behind the other grating.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Andrea, deeply affected.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Good morning, Benedetto,&rdquo; said Bertuccio, with his deep,
        hollow voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You&mdash;you?&rdquo; said the young man, looking fearfully around
        him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you not recognize me, unhappy child?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Silence,&mdash;be silent!&rdquo; said Andrea, who knew the delicate
        sense of hearing possessed by the walls; &ldquo;for Heaven&rsquo;s sake,
        do not speak so loud!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You wish to speak with me alone, do you not?&rdquo; said Bertuccio.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is well.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And Bertuccio, feeling in his pocket, signed to a keeper whom he saw through
        the window of the wicket.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Read?&rdquo; he said.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Andrea.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;An order to conduct you to a room, and to leave you there to talk
        to me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Andrea, leaping with joy. Then he mentally added,&mdash;&ldquo;Still
        my unknown protector! I am not forgotten. They wish for secrecy, since we
        are to converse in a private room. I understand, Bertuccio has been sent
        by my protector.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The keeper spoke for a moment with an official, then opened the iron gates
        and conducted Andrea to a room on the first floor. The room was
        whitewashed, as is the custom in prisons, but it looked quite brilliant to
        a prisoner, though a stove, a bed, a chair, and a table formed the whole
        of its sumptuous furniture. Bertuccio sat down upon the chair, Andrea
        threw himself upon the bed; the keeper retired.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the steward, &ldquo;what have you to tell me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you?&rdquo; said Andrea.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You speak first.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no. You must have much to tell me, since you have come to seek
        me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50155m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, be it so. You have continued your course of villany; you have
        robbed&mdash;you have assassinated.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I should say! If you had me taken to a private room only to
        tell me this, you might have saved yourself the trouble. I know all these
        things. But there are some with which, on the contrary, I am not
        acquainted. Let us talk of those, if you please. Who sent you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, come, you are going on quickly, M. Benedetto!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, and to the point. Let us dispense with useless words. Who
        sends you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No one.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How did you know I was in prison?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I recognized you, some time since, as the insolent dandy who so
        gracefully mounted his horse in the Champs-Élysées.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, the Champs-Élysées? Ah, yes; we burn, as they say at the game
        of pincette. The Champs-Élysées? Come, let us talk a little about my
        father.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Who, then, am I?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You, sir?&mdash;you are my adopted father. But it was not you, I
        presume, who placed at my disposal 100,000 francs, which I spent in four
        or five months; it was not you who manufactured an Italian gentleman for
        my father; it was not you who introduced me into the world, and had me
        invited to a certain dinner at Auteuil, which I fancy I am eating at this
        moment, in company with the most distinguished people in Paris&mdash;amongst
        the rest with a certain procureur, whose acquaintance I did very wrong not
        to cultivate, for he would have been very useful to me just now;&mdash;it
        was not you, in fact, who bailed me for one or two millions, when the
        fatal discovery of my little secret took place. Come, speak, my worthy
        Corsican, speak!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you wish me to say?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will help you. You were speaking of the Champs-Élysées just now,
        worthy foster-father.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, in the Champs-Élysées there resides a very rich gentleman.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At whose house you robbed and murdered, did you not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I believe I did.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The Count of Monte Cristo?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis you who have named him, as M. Racine says. Well, am I to
        rush into his arms, and strain him to my heart, crying, &lsquo;My father,
        my father!&rsquo; like Monsieur
        Pixérécourt.&rdquo;<a href="#linknote-27" name="linknoteref-27" id="linknoteref-27">27</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do not let us jest,&rdquo; gravely replied Bertuccio, &ldquo;and
        dare not to utter that name again as you have pronounced it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bah,&rdquo; said Andrea, a little overcome, by the solemnity of
        Bertuccio&rsquo;s manner, &ldquo;why not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because the person who bears it is too highly favored by Heaven to
        be the father of such a wretch as you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, these are fine words.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And there will be fine doings, if you do not take care.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Menaces&mdash;I do not fear them. I will say&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you think you are engaged with a pygmy like yourself?&rdquo;
        said Bertuccio, in so calm a tone, and with so steadfast a look, that
        Andrea was moved to the very soul. &ldquo;Do you think you have to do with
        galley-slaves, or novices in the world? Benedetto, you are fallen into
        terrible hands; they are ready to open for you&mdash;make use of them. Do
        not play with the thunderbolt they have laid aside for a moment, but which
        they can take up again instantly, if you attempt to intercept their
        movements.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50157m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My father&mdash;I will know who my father is,&rdquo; said the
        obstinate youth; &ldquo;I will perish if I must, but I <i>will</i> know
        it. What does scandal signify to me? What possessions, what reputation,
        what &lsquo;pull,&rsquo; as Beauchamp says,&mdash;have I? You great people
        always lose something by scandal, notwithstanding your millions. Come, who
        is my father?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I came to tell you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; cried Benedetto, his eyes sparkling with joy. Just then
        the door opened, and the jailer, addressing himself to Bertuccio, said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Excuse me, sir, but the examining magistrate is waiting for the
        prisoner.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And so closes our interview,&rdquo; said Andrea to the worthy
        steward; &ldquo;I wish the troublesome fellow were at the devil!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will return tomorrow,&rdquo; said Bertuccio.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Good! Gendarmes, I am at your service. Ah, sir, do leave a few
        crowns for me at the gate that I may have some things I am in need of!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It shall be done,&rdquo; replied Bertuccio.
      </p>
      <p>
        Andrea extended his hand; Bertuccio kept his own in his pocket, and merely
        jingled a few pieces of money.
      </p>
