      <h2>Chapter 17. The Abbé&rsquo;s Chamber</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter having passed
        with tolerable ease through the subterranean passage, which, however, did
        not admit of their holding themselves erect, the two friends reached the
        further end of the corridor, into which the abbé&rsquo;s cell opened; from
        that point the passage became much narrower, and barely permitted one to
        creep through on hands and knees. The floor of the abbé&rsquo;s cell was
        paved, and it had been by raising one of the stones in the most obscure
        corner that Faria had been able to commence the laborious task of which
        Dantès had witnessed the completion.
      </p>
      <p>
        As he entered the chamber of his friend, Dantès cast around one eager and
        searching glance in quest of the expected marvels, but nothing more than
        common met his view.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said the abbé; &ldquo;we have some hours before
        us&mdash;it is now just a quarter past twelve o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
        Instinctively Dantès turned round to observe by what watch or clock the
        abbé had been able so accurately to specify the hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Look at this ray of light which enters by my window,&rdquo; said
        the abbé, &ldquo;and then observe the lines traced on the wall. Well, by
        means of these lines, which are in accordance with the double motion of
        the earth, and the ellipse it describes round the sun, I am enabled to
        ascertain the precise hour with more minuteness than if I possessed a
        watch; for that might be broken or deranged in its movements, while the
        sun and earth never vary in their appointed paths.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        This last explanation was wholly lost upon Dantès, who had always
        imagined, from seeing the sun rise from behind the mountains and set in
        the Mediterranean, that it moved, and not the earth. A double movement of
        the globe he inhabited, and of which he could feel nothing, appeared to
        him perfectly impossible. Each word that fell from his companion&rsquo;s
        lips seemed fraught with the mysteries of science, as worthy of digging
        out as the gold and diamonds in the mines of Guzerat and Golconda, which
        he could just recollect having visited during a voyage made in his
        earliest youth.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he to the abbé, &ldquo;I am anxious to see your
        treasures.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The abbé smiled, and, proceeding to the disused fireplace, raised, by the
        help of his chisel, a long stone, which had doubtless been the hearth,
        beneath which was a cavity of considerable depth, serving as a safe
        depository of the articles mentioned to Dantès.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0213m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you wish to see first?&rdquo; asked the abbé.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, your great work on the monarchy of Italy!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Faria then drew forth from his hiding-place three or four rolls of linen,
        laid one over the other, like folds of papyrus. These rolls consisted of
        slips of cloth about four inches wide and eighteen long; they were all
        carefully numbered and closely covered with writing, so legible that
        Dantès could easily read it, as well as make out the sense&mdash;it being
        in Italian, a language he, as a Provençal, perfectly understood.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there is the work complete. I wrote
        the word <i>finis</i> at the end of the sixty-eighth strip about a week
        ago. I have torn up two of my shirts, and as many handkerchiefs as I was
        master of, to complete the precious pages. Should I ever get out of prison
        and find in all Italy a printer courageous enough to publish what I have
        composed, my literary reputation is forever secured.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; answered Dantès. &ldquo;Now let me behold the curious
        pens with which you have written your work.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said Faria, showing to the young man a slender stick
        about six inches long, and much resembling the size of the handle of a
        fine painting-brush, to the end of which was tied, by a piece of thread,
        one of those cartilages of which the abbé had before spoken to Dantès; it
        was pointed, and divided at the nib like an ordinary pen. Dantès examined
        it with intense admiration, then looked around to see the instrument with
        which it had been shaped so correctly into form.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; said Faria; &ldquo;the penknife. That&rsquo;s my
        masterpiece. I made it, as well as this larger knife, out of an old iron
        candlestick.&rdquo; The penknife was sharp and keen as a razor; as for the
        other knife, it would serve a double purpose, and with it one could cut
        and thrust.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dantès examined the various articles shown to him with the same attention
        that he had bestowed on the curiosities and strange tools exhibited in the
        shops at Marseilles as the works of the savages in the South Seas from
        whence they had been brought by the different trading vessels.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As for the ink,&rdquo; said Faria, &ldquo;I told you how I managed
        to obtain that&mdash;and I only just make it from time to time, as I
        require it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;One thing still puzzles me,&rdquo; observed Dantès, &ldquo;and that
        is how you managed to do all this by daylight?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I worked at night also,&rdquo; replied Faria.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Night!&mdash;why, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, are your eyes like cats&rsquo;,
        that you can see to work in the dark?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed they are not; but God has supplied man with the intelligence
        that enables him to overcome the limitations of natural conditions. I
        furnished myself with a light.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You did? Pray tell me how.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I separated the fat from the meat served to me, melted it, and so
        made oil&mdash;here is my lamp.&rdquo; So saying, the abbé exhibited a
        sort of torch very similar to those used in public illuminations.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But how do you procure a light?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, here are two flints and a piece of burnt linen.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And matches?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I pretended that I had a disorder of the skin, and asked for a
        little sulphur, which was readily supplied.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Dantès laid the different things he had been looking at on the table, and
        stood with his head drooping on his breast, as though overwhelmed by the
        perseverance and strength of Faria&rsquo;s mind.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0215m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have not seen all yet,&rdquo; continued Faria, &ldquo;for I did
        not think it wise to trust all my treasures in the same hiding-place. Let
        us shut this one up.&rdquo; They put the stone back in its place; the abbé
        sprinkled a little dust over it to conceal the traces of its having been
        removed, rubbed his foot well on it to make it assume the same appearance
        as the other, and then, going towards his bed, he removed it from the spot
        it stood in. Behind the head of the bed, and concealed by a stone fitting
        in so closely as to defy all suspicion, was a hollow space, and in this
        space a ladder of cords between twenty-five and thirty feet in length.
        Dantès closely and eagerly examined it; he found it firm, solid, and
        compact enough to bear any weight.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Who supplied you with the materials for making this wonderful work?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I tore up several of my shirts, and ripped out the seams in the
        sheets of my bed, during my three years&rsquo; imprisonment at
        Fenestrelle; and when I was removed to the Château d&rsquo;If, I managed
        to bring the ravellings with me, so that I have been able to finish my
        work here.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And was it not discovered that your sheets were unhemmed?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, for when I had taken out the thread I required, I hemmed
        the edges over again.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With what?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With this needle,&rdquo; said the abbé, as, opening his ragged
        vestments, he showed Dantès a long, sharp fish-bone, with a small
        perforated eye for the thread, a small portion of which still remained in
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I once thought,&rdquo; continued Faria, &ldquo;of removing
        these iron bars, and letting myself down from the window, which, as you
        see, is somewhat wider than yours, although I should have enlarged it
        still more preparatory to my flight; however, I discovered that I should
        merely have dropped into a sort of inner court, and I therefore renounced
        the project altogether as too full of risk and danger. Nevertheless, I
        carefully preserved my ladder against one of those unforeseen
        opportunities of which I spoke just now, and which sudden chance
        frequently brings about.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        While affecting to be deeply engaged in examining the ladder, the mind of
        Dantès was, in fact, busily occupied by the idea that a person so intelligent,
        ingenious, and clear-sighted as the abbé might probably be able to solve the
        dark mystery of his own misfortunes, where he himself could see nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What are you thinking of?&rdquo; asked the abbé smilingly, imputing
        the deep abstraction in which his visitor was plunged to the excess of his
        awe and wonder.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I was reflecting, in the first place,&rdquo; replied Dantès,
        &ldquo;upon the enormous degree of intelligence and ability you must have
        employed to reach the high perfection to which you have attained. What
        would you not have accomplished if you had been free?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Possibly nothing at all; the overflow of my brain would probably,
        in a state of freedom, have evaporated in a thousand follies; misfortune
        is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect.
        Compression is needed to explode gunpowder. Captivity has brought my
        mental faculties to a focus; and you are well aware that from the
        collision of clouds electricity is produced&mdash;from electricity,
        lightning, from lightning, illumination.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Dantès. &ldquo;I know nothing. Some of your
        words are to me quite empty of meaning. You must be blessed indeed to
        possess the knowledge you have.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The abbé smiled. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but you had another
        subject for your thoughts; did you not say so just now?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I did!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have told me as yet but one of them&mdash;let me hear the
        other.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It was this,&mdash;that while you had related to me all the
        particulars of your past life, you were perfectly unacquainted with mine.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your life, my young friend, has not been of sufficient length to
        admit of your having passed through any very important events.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It has been long enough to inflict on me a great and undeserved
        misfortune. I would fain fix the source of it on man that I may no longer
        vent reproaches upon Heaven.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you profess ignorance of the crime with which you are charged?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do, indeed; and this I swear by the two beings most dear to me
        upon earth,&mdash;my father and Mercédès.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said the abbé, closing his hiding-place, and pushing
        the bed back to its original situation, &ldquo;let me hear your story.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Dantès obeyed, and commenced what he called his history, but which
        consisted only of the account of a voyage to India, and two or three
        voyages to the Levant, until he arrived at the recital of his last cruise,
        with the death of Captain Leclere, and the receipt of a packet to be
        delivered by himself to the grand marshal; his interview with that
        personage, and his receiving, in place of the packet brought, a letter
        addressed to a Monsieur Noirtier&mdash;his arrival at Marseilles, and
        interview with his father&mdash;his affection for Mercédès, and their
        nuptual feast&mdash;his arrest and subsequent examination, his temporary
        detention at the Palais de Justice, and his final imprisonment in the
        Château d&rsquo;If. From this point everything was a blank to Dantès&mdash;he
        knew nothing more, not even the length of time he had been imprisoned. His
        recital finished, the abbé reflected long and earnestly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There is,&rdquo; said he, at the end of his meditations, &ldquo;a
        clever maxim, which bears upon what I was saying to you some little while
        ago, and that is, that unless wicked ideas take root in a naturally
        depraved mind, human nature, in a right and wholesome state, revolts at
        crime. Still, from an artificial civilization have originated wants,
        vices, and false tastes, which occasionally become so powerful as to
        stifle within us all good feelings, and ultimately to lead us into guilt
        and wickedness. From this view of things, then, comes the axiom that if
        you visit to discover the author of any bad action, seek first to discover
        the person to whom the perpetration of that bad action could be in any way
        advantageous. Now, to apply it in your case,&mdash;to whom could your
        disappearance have been serviceable?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To no one, by Heaven! I was a very insignificant person.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do not speak thus, for your reply evinces neither logic nor
        philosophy; everything is relative, my dear young friend, from the king
        who stands in the way of his successor, to the employee who keeps his
        rival out of a place. Now, in the event of the king&rsquo;s death, his
        successor inherits a crown,&mdash;when the employee dies, the
        supernumerary steps into his shoes, and receives his salary of twelve
        thousand livres. Well, these twelve thousand livres are his civil list,
        and are as essential to him as the twelve millions of a king. Everyone,
        from the highest to the lowest degree, has his place on the social ladder,
        and is beset by stormy passions and conflicting interests, as in Descartes&rsquo;
        theory of pressure and impulsion. But these forces increase as we go
        higher, so that we have a spiral which in defiance of reason rests upon
        the apex and not on the base. Now let us return to your particular world.
        You say you were on the point of being made captain of the <i>Pharaon</i>?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And about to become the husband of a young and lovely girl?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now, could anyone have had any interest in preventing the
        accomplishment of these two things? But let us first settle the question
        as to its being the interest of anyone to hinder you from being captain of
        the <i>Pharaon</i>. What say you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I cannot believe such was the case. I was generally liked on board,
        and had the sailors possessed the right of selecting a captain themselves,
        I feel convinced their choice would have fallen on me. There was only one
        person among the crew who had any feeling of ill-will towards me. I had
        quarelled with him some time previously, and had even challenged him to
        fight me; but he refused.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now we are getting on. And what was this man&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Danglars.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What rank did he hold on board?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He was supercargo.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And had you been captain, should you have retained him in his
        employment?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not if the choice had remained with me, for I had frequently
        observed inaccuracies in his accounts.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Good again! Now then, tell me, was any person present during your
        last conversation with Captain Leclere?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; we were quite alone.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Could your conversation have been overheard by anyone?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It might, for the cabin door was open&mdash;and&mdash;stay; now I
        recollect,&mdash;Danglars himself passed by just as Captain Leclere was
        giving me the packet for the grand marshal.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s better,&rdquo; cried the abbé; &ldquo;now we are on
        the right scent. Did you take anybody with you when you put into the port
        of Elba?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nobody.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Somebody there received your packet, and gave you a letter in place
        of it, I think?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; the grand marshal did.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what did you do with that letter?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Put it into my portfolio.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You had your portfolio with you, then? Now, how could a sailor find
        room in his pocket for a portfolio large enough to contain an official
        letter?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are right; it was left on board.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then it was not till your return to the ship that you put the
        letter in the portfolio?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what did you do with this same letter while returning from
        Porto-Ferrajo to the vessel?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I carried it in my hand.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So that when you went on board the <i>Pharaon</i>, everybody could
        see that you held a letter in your hand?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Danglars, as well as the rest?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Danglars, as well as others.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now, listen to me, and try to recall every circumstance attending
        your arrest. Do you recollect the words in which the information against
        you was formulated?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh yes, I read it over three times, and the words sank deeply into
        my memory.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Repeat it to me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Dantès paused a moment, then said, &ldquo;This is it, word for word:
        &lsquo;The king&rsquo;s attorney is informed by a friend to the throne and
        religion, that one Edmond Dantès, mate on board the <i>Pharaon</i>, this
        day arrived from Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo,
        has been intrusted by Murat with a packet for the usurper; again, by the
        usurper, with a letter for the Bonapartist Club in Paris. This proof of
        his guilt may be procured by his immediate arrest, as the letter will be
        found either about his person, at his father&rsquo;s residence, or in his
        cabin on board the <i>Pharaon</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The abbé shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;The thing is clear as day,&rdquo;
        said he; &ldquo;and you must have had a very confiding nature, as well as
        a good heart, not to have suspected the origin of the whole affair.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you really think so? Ah, that would indeed be infamous.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How did Danglars usually write?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In a handsome, running hand.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And how was the anonymous letter written?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Backhanded.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Again the abbé smiled. &ldquo;Disguised.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It was very boldly written, if disguised.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Stop a bit,&rdquo; said the abbé, taking up what he called his pen,
        and, after dipping it into the ink, he wrote on a piece of prepared linen,
        with his left hand, the first two or three words of the accusation. Dantès
        drew back, and gazed on the abbé with a sensation almost amounting to
        terror.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How very astonishing!&rdquo; cried he at length. &ldquo;Why your
        writing exactly resembles that of the accusation.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Simply because that accusation had been written with the left hand;
        and I have noticed that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That while the writing of different persons done with the right
        hand varies, that performed with the left hand is invariably uniform.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have evidently seen and observed everything.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us proceed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, yes!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now as regards the second question.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am listening.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Was there any person whose interest it was to prevent your marriage
        with Mercédès?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; a young man who loved her.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And his name was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Fernand.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is a Spanish name, I think?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He was a Catalan.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You imagine him capable of writing the letter?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no; he would more likely have got rid of me by sticking a knife
        into me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is in strict accordance with the Spanish character; an
        assassination they will unhesitatingly commit, but an act of cowardice,
        never.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Dantès, &ldquo;the various circumstances
        mentioned in the letter were wholly unknown to him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You had never spoken of them yourself to anyone?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To no one.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not even to your mistress?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, not even to my betrothed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then it is Danglars.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I feel quite sure of it now.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Wait a little. Pray, was Danglars acquainted with Fernand?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No&mdash;yes, he was. Now I recollect&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at
        Père Pamphile&rsquo;s the evening before the day fixed for my wedding.
        They were in earnest conversation. Danglars was joking in a friendly way,
        but Fernand looked pale and agitated.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Were they alone?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There was a third person with them whom I knew perfectly well, and
        who had, in all probability made their acquaintance; he was a tailor named
        Caderousse, but he was very drunk. Stay!&mdash;stay!&mdash;How strange
        that it should not have occurred to me before! Now I remember quite well,
        that on the table round which they were sitting were pens, ink, and paper.
        Oh, the heartless, treacherous scoundrels!&rdquo; exclaimed Dantès,
        pressing his hand to his throbbing brows.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is there anything else I can assist you in discovering, besides the
        villany of your friends?&rdquo; inquired the abbé with a laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; replied Dantès eagerly; &ldquo;I would beg of you,
        who see so completely to the depths of things, and to whom the greatest
        mystery seems but an easy riddle, to explain to me how it was that I
        underwent no second examination, was never brought to trial, and, above
        all, was condemned without ever having had sentence passed on me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is altogether a different and more serious matter,&rdquo;
        responded the abbé. &ldquo;The ways of justice are frequently too dark and
        mysterious to be easily penetrated. All we have hitherto done in the
        matter has been child&rsquo;s play. If you wish me to enter upon the more
        difficult part of the business, you must assist me by the most minute
        information on every point.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Pray ask me whatever questions you please; for, in good truth, you
        see more clearly into my life than I do myself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In the first place, then, who examined you,&mdash;the king&rsquo;s
        attorney, his deputy, or a magistrate?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The deputy.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Was he young or old?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;About six or seven-and-twenty years of age, I should say.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So,&rdquo; answered the abbé. &ldquo;Old enough to be ambitious,
        but too young to be corrupt. And how did he treat you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With more of mildness than severity.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you tell him your whole story?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I did.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And did his conduct change at all in the course of your
        examination?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He did appear much disturbed when he read the letter that had
        brought me into this scrape. He seemed quite overcome by my misfortune.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By your misfortune?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you feel quite sure that it was your misfortune he deplored?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He gave me one great proof of his sympathy, at any rate.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And that?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He burnt the sole evidence that could at all have criminated me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What? the accusation?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; the letter.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I saw it done.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That alters the case. This man might, after all, be a greater
        scoundrel than you have thought possible.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said Dantès, &ldquo;you make me shudder. Is
        the world filled with tigers and crocodiles?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; and remember that two-legged tigers and crocodiles are more
        dangerous than the others.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Never mind; let us go on.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With all my heart! You tell me he burned the letter?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He did; saying at the same time, &lsquo;You see I thus destroy the
        only proof existing against you.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This action is somewhat too sublime to be natural.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am sure of it. To whom was this letter addressed?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To M. Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, No. 13, Paris.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now can you conceive of any interest that your heroic deputy could
        possibly have had in the destruction of that letter?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, it is not altogether impossible he might have had, for he made
        me promise several times never to speak of that letter to anyone, assuring
        me he so advised me for my own interest; and, more than this, he insisted
        on my taking a solemn oath never to utter the name mentioned in the
        address.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Noirtier!&rdquo; repeated the abbé; &ldquo;Noirtier!&mdash;I knew a
        person of that name at the court of the Queen of Etruria,&mdash;a
        Noirtier, who had been a Girondin during the Revolution! What was your
        deputy called?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;De Villefort!&rdquo; The abbé burst into a fit of laughter, while
        Dantès gazed on him in utter astonishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What ails you?&rdquo; said he at length.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you see that ray of sunlight?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, the whole thing is more clear to me than that sunbeam is to
        you. Poor fellow! poor young man! And you tell me this magistrate
        expressed great sympathy and commiseration for you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He did.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And the worthy man destroyed your compromising letter?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And then made you swear never to utter the name of Noirtier?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, you poor short-sighted simpleton, can you not guess who this
        Noirtier was, whose very name he was so careful to keep concealed?
        This Noirtier was his father!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Had a thunderbolt fallen at the feet of Dantès, or hell opened its yawning
        gulf before him, he could not have been more completely transfixed with
        horror than he was at the sound of these unexpected words. Starting up, he
        clasped his hands around his head as though to prevent his very brain from
        bursting, and exclaimed, &ldquo;His father! his father!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, his father,&rdquo; replied the abbé; &ldquo;his right name was
        Noirtier de Villefort.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At this instant a bright light shot through the mind of Dantès, and cleared up
        all that had been dark and obscure before. The change that had come over Villefort
        during the examination, the destruction of the letter, the exacted promise, the
        almost supplicating tones of the magistrate, who seemed rather to implore mercy
        than to pronounce punishment,&mdash;all returned with a stunning force to
        his memory. He cried out, and staggered against the wall like a drunken
        man, then he hurried to the opening that led from the abbé&rsquo;s cell to
        his own, and said, &ldquo;I must be alone, to think over all this.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        When he regained his dungeon, he threw himself on his bed, where the
        turnkey found him in the evening visit, sitting with fixed gaze and
        contracted features, dumb and motionless as a statue. During these hours
        of profound meditation, which to him had seemed only minutes, he had
        formed a fearful resolution, and bound himself to its fulfilment by a
        solemn oath.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dantès was at length roused from his reverie by the voice of Faria, who,
        having also been visited by his jailer, had come to invite his
        fellow-sufferer to share his supper. The reputation of being out of his
        mind, though harmlessly and even amusingly so, had procured for the abbé
        unusual privileges. He was supplied with bread of a finer, whiter quality
        than the usual prison fare, and even regaled each Sunday with a small
        quantity of wine. Now this was a Sunday, and the abbé had come to ask his
        young companion to share the luxuries with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dantès followed him; his features were no longer contracted, and now wore their
        usual expression, but there was that in his whole appearance that bespoke one
        who had come to a fixed and desperate resolve. Faria bent on him his penetrating
        eye.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I regret now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;having helped you in your late
        inquiries, or having given you the information I did.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; inquired Dantès.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because it has instilled a new passion in your heart&mdash;that of
        vengeance.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Dantès smiled. &ldquo;Let us talk of something else,&rdquo; said he.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again the abbé looked at him, then mournfully shook his head; but in
        accordance with Dantès&rsquo; request, he began to speak of other matters.
        The elder prisoner was one of those persons whose conversation, like that
        of all who have experienced many trials, contained many useful and
        important hints as well as sound information; but it was never
        egotistical, for the unfortunate man never alluded to his own sorrows.
        Dantès listened with admiring attention to all he said; some of his
        remarks corresponded with what he already knew, or applied to the sort of
        knowledge his nautical life had enabled him to acquire. A part of the good
        abbé&rsquo;s words, however, were wholly incomprehensible to him; but,
        like the aurora which guides the navigator in northern latitudes, opened
        new vistas to the inquiring mind of the listener, and gave fantastic
        glimpses of new horizons, enabling him justly to estimate the delight an
        intellectual mind would have in following one so richly gifted as Faria
        along the heights of truth, where he was so much at home.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You must teach me a small part of what you know,&rdquo; said
        Dantès, &ldquo;if only to prevent your growing weary of me. I can well
        believe that so learned a person as yourself would prefer absolute
        solitude to being tormented with the company of one as ignorant and
        uninformed as myself. If you will only agree to my request, I promise you
        never to mention another word about escaping.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The abbé smiled.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas, my boy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;human knowledge is confined
        within very narrow limits; and when I have taught you mathematics,
        physics, history, and the three or four modern languages with which I am
        acquainted, you will know as much as I do myself. Now, it will scarcely
        require two years for me to communicate to you the stock of learning I
        possess.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Two years!&rdquo; exclaimed Dantès; &ldquo;do you really believe I
        can acquire all these things in so short a time?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not their application, certainly, but their principles you may; to
        learn is not to know; there are the learners and the learned. Memory makes
        the one, philosophy the other.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But cannot one learn philosophy?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Philosophy cannot be taught; it is the application of the sciences
        to truth; it is like the golden cloud in which the Messiah went up into
        heaven.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Dantès, &ldquo;What shall you teach me
        first? I am in a hurry to begin. I want to learn.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; said the abbé. And that very evening the
        prisoners sketched a plan of education, to be entered upon the following
        day. Dantès possessed a prodigious memory, combined with an astonishing
        quickness and readiness of conception; the mathematical turn of his mind
        rendered him apt at all kinds of calculation, while his naturally poetical
        feelings threw a light and pleasing veil over the dry reality of
        arithmetical computation, or the rigid severity of geometry. He already
        knew Italian, and had also picked up a little of the Romaic dialect during
        voyages to the East; and by the aid of these two languages he easily
        comprehended the construction of all the others, so that at the end of six
        months he began to speak Spanish, English, and German.
      </p>
      <p>
        In strict accordance with the promise made to the abbé, Dantès spoke no more
        of escape. Perhaps the delight his studies afforded him left no room for such
        thoughts; perhaps the recollection that he had pledged his word (on which
        his sense of honor was keen) kept him from referring in any way to the
        possibilities of flight. Days, even months, passed by unheeded in one
        rapid and instructive course. At the end of a year Dantès was a new man.
        Dantès observed, however, that Faria, in spite of the relief his society
        afforded, daily grew sadder; one thought seemed incessantly to harass and
        distract his mind. Sometimes he would fall into long reveries, sigh
        heavily and involuntarily, then suddenly rise, and, with folded arms,
        begin pacing the confined space of his dungeon. One day he stopped all at
        once, and exclaimed:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, if there were no sentinel!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There shall not be one a minute longer than you please,&rdquo; said
        Dantès, who had followed the working of his thoughts as accurately as
        though his brain were enclosed in crystal so clear as to display its
        minutest operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have already told you,&rdquo; answered the abbé, &ldquo;that I
        loathe the idea of shedding blood.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And yet the murder, if you choose to call it so, would be simply a
        measure of self-preservation.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No matter! I could never agree to it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Still, you have thought of it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Incessantly, alas!&rdquo; cried the abbé.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you have discovered a means of regaining our freedom, have you
        not?&rdquo; asked Dantès eagerly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have; if it were only possible to place a deaf and blind sentinel
        in the gallery beyond us.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He shall be both blind and deaf,&rdquo; replied the young man, with
        an air of determination that made his companion shudder.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried the abbé; &ldquo;impossible!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Dantès endeavored to renew the subject; the abbé shook his head in token of
        disapproval, and refused to make any further response. Three months passed
        away.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you strong?&rdquo; the abbé asked one day of Dantès. The young
        man, in reply, took up the chisel, bent it into the form of a horseshoe,
        and then as readily straightened it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And will you engage not to do any harm to the sentry, except as a
        last resort?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I promise on my honor.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the abbé, &ldquo;we may hope to put our design
        into execution.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And how long shall we be in accomplishing the necessary work?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At least a year.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And shall we begin at once?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At once.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We have lost a year to no purpose!&rdquo; cried Dantès.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you consider the last twelve months to have been wasted?&rdquo;
        asked the abbé.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Forgive me!&rdquo; cried Edmond, blushing deeply.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Tut, tut!&rdquo; answered the abbé, &ldquo;man is but man after
        all, and you are about the best specimen of the genus I have ever known.
        Come, let me show you my plan.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The abbé then showed Dantès the sketch he had made for their escape. It consisted
        of a plan of his own cell and that of Dantès, with the passage which united them.
        In this passage he proposed to drive a level as they do in mines; this level would
        bring the two prisoners immediately beneath the gallery where the sentry
        kept watch; once there, a large excavation would be made, and one of the
        flag-stones with which the gallery was paved be so completely loosened
        that at the desired moment it would give way beneath the feet of the
        soldier, who, stunned by his fall, would be immediately bound and gagged
        by Dantès before he had power to offer any resistance. The prisoners were
        then to make their way through one of the gallery windows, and to let
        themselves down from the outer walls by means of the abbé&rsquo;s ladder
        of cords.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dantès&rsquo; eyes sparkled with joy, and he rubbed his hands with delight at
        the idea of a plan so simple, yet apparently so certain to succeed.
        That very day the miners began their labors, with a vigor and alacrity
        proportionate to their long rest from fatigue and their hopes of ultimate
        success. Nothing interrupted the progress of the work except the necessity
        that each was under of returning to his cell in anticipation of the
        turnkey&rsquo;s visits. They had learned to distinguish the almost
        imperceptible sound of his footsteps as he descended towards their
        dungeons, and happily, never failed of being prepared for his coming. The
        fresh earth excavated during their present work, and which would have
        entirely blocked up the old passage, was thrown, by degrees and with the
        utmost precaution, out of the window in either Faria&rsquo;s or Dantès&rsquo;
        cell, the rubbish being first pulverized so finely that the night wind
        carried it far away without permitting the smallest trace to remain.
      </p>
      <p>
        More than a year had been consumed in this undertaking, the only tools for
        which had been a chisel, a knife, and a wooden lever; Faria still
        continuing to instruct Dantès by conversing with him, sometimes in one
        language, sometimes in another; at others, relating to him the history of
        nations and great men who from time to time have risen to fame and trodden
        the path of glory. The abbé was a man of the world, and had, moreover, mixed in
        the first society of the day; he wore an air of melancholy dignity which Dantès,
        thanks to the imitative powers bestowed on him by nature, easily acquired,
        as well as that outward polish and politeness he had before been wanting
        in, and which is seldom possessed except by those who have been placed in
        constant intercourse with persons of high birth and breeding.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of fifteen months the level was finished, and the excavation completed
        beneath the gallery, and the two workmen could distinctly hear the
        measured tread of the sentinel as he paced to and fro over their heads.
        Compelled, as they were, to await a night sufficiently dark to favor their
        flight, they were obliged to defer their final attempt till that
        auspicious moment should arrive; their greatest dread now was lest the
        stone through which the sentry was doomed to fall should give way before
        its right time, and this they had in some measure provided against by
        propping it up with a small beam which they had discovered in the walls
        through which they had worked their way. Dantès was occupied in arranging
        this piece of wood when he heard Faria, who had remained in Edmond&rsquo;s
        cell for the purpose of cutting a peg to secure their rope-ladder, call to
        him in a tone indicative of great suffering. Dantès hastened to his
        dungeon, where he found him standing in the middle of the room, pale as
        death, his forehead streaming with perspiration, and his hands clenched
        tightly together.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Gracious heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed Dantès, &ldquo;what is the
        matter? what has happened?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Quick! quick!&rdquo; returned the abbé, &ldquo;listen to what I
        have to say.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Dantès looked in fear and wonder at the livid countenance of Faria, whose eyes,
        already dull and sunken, were surrounded by purple circles, while his lips were
        white as those of a corpse, and his very hair seemed to stand on end.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Tell me, I beseech you, what ails you?&rdquo; cried Dantès, letting
        his chisel fall to the floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; faltered out the abbé, &ldquo;all is over with me. I
        am seized with a terrible, perhaps mortal illness; I can feel that the
        paroxysm is fast approaching. I had a similar attack the year previous to
        my imprisonment. This malady admits but of one remedy; I will tell you
        what that is. Go into my cell as quickly as you can; draw out one of the
        feet that support the bed; you will find it has been hollowed out for the
        purpose of containing a small phial you will see there half-filled with a
        red-looking fluid. Bring it to me&mdash;or rather&mdash;no, no!&mdash;I
        may be found here, therefore help me back to my room while I have the
        strength to drag myself along. Who knows what may happen, or how long the
        attack may last?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        In spite of the magnitude of the misfortune which thus suddenly frustrated
        his hopes, Dantès did not lose his presence of mind, but descended into
        the passage, dragging his unfortunate companion with him; then,
        half-carrying, half-supporting him, he managed to reach the abbé&rsquo;s
        chamber, when he immediately laid the sufferer on his bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; said the poor abbé, shivering as though his veins
        were filled with ice. &ldquo;I am about to be seized with a fit of
        catalepsy; when it comes to its height I shall probably lie still and
        motionless as though dead, uttering neither sigh nor groan. On the other
        hand, the symptoms may be much more violent, and cause me to fall into
        fearful convulsions, foam at the mouth, and cry out loudly. Take care my
        cries are not heard, for if they are it is more than probable I should be
        removed to another part of the prison, and we be separated forever. When I
        become quite motionless, cold, and rigid as a corpse, then, and not
        before,&mdash;be careful about this,&mdash;force open my teeth with the
        knife, pour from eight to ten drops of the liquor contained in the phial
        down my throat, and I may perhaps revive.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps!&rdquo; exclaimed Dantès in grief-stricken tones.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; cried the abbé, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;die&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0229m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        So sudden and violent was the fit that the unfortunate prisoner was unable
        to complete the sentence; a violent convulsion shook his whole frame, his
        eyes started from their sockets, his mouth was drawn on one side, his
        cheeks became purple, he struggled, foamed, dashed himself about, and
        uttered the most dreadful cries, which, however, Dantès prevented from
        being heard by covering his head with the blanket. The fit lasted two
        hours; then, more helpless than an infant, and colder and paler than
        marble, more crushed and broken than a reed trampled under foot, he fell
        back, doubled up in one last convulsion, and became as rigid as a corpse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edmond waited till life seemed extinct in the body of his friend, then,
        taking up the knife, he with difficulty forced open the closely fixed
        jaws, carefully administered the appointed number of drops, and anxiously
        awaited the result. An hour passed away and the old man gave no sign of
        returning animation. Dantès began to fear he had delayed too long ere he
        administered the remedy, and, thrusting his hands into his hair, continued
        gazing on the lifeless features of his friend. At length a slight color
        tinged the livid cheeks, consciousness returned to the dull, open
        eyeballs, a faint sigh issued from the lips, and the sufferer made a
        feeble effort to move.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is saved! he is saved!&rdquo; cried Dantès in a paroxysm of
        delight.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sick man was not yet able to speak, but he pointed with evident
        anxiety towards the door. Dantès listened, and plainly distinguished the
        approaching steps of the jailer. It was therefore near seven o&rsquo;clock;
        but Edmond&rsquo;s anxiety had put all thoughts of time out of his head.
      </p>
      <p>
        The young man sprang to the entrance, darted through it, carefully drawing
        the stone over the opening, and hurried to his cell. He had scarcely done
        so before the door opened, and the jailer saw the prisoner seated as usual
        on the side of his bed. Almost before the key had turned in the lock, and
        before the departing steps of the jailer had died away in the long
        corridor he had to traverse, Dantès, whose restless anxiety concerning his
        friend left him no desire to touch the food brought him, hurried back to
        the abbé&rsquo;s chamber, and raising the stone by pressing his head
        against it, was soon beside the sick man&rsquo;s couch. Faria had now
        fully regained his consciousness, but he still lay helpless and exhausted
        on his miserable bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I did not expect to see you again,&rdquo; said he feebly, to
        Dantès.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; asked the young man. &ldquo;Did you fancy
        yourself dying?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I had no such idea; but, knowing that all was ready for flight,
        I thought you might have made your escape.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The deep glow of indignation suffused the cheeks of Dantès.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Without you? Did you really think me capable of that?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At least,&rdquo; said the abbé, &ldquo;I now see how wrong such an
        opinion would have been. Alas, alas! I am fearfully exhausted and
        debilitated by this attack.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Be of good cheer,&rdquo; replied Dantès; &ldquo;your strength will
        return.&rdquo; And as he spoke he seated himself near the bed beside
        Faria, and took his hands. The abbé shook his head.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The last attack I had,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;lasted but half an
        hour, and after it I was hungry, and got up without help; now I can move
        neither my right arm nor leg, and my head seems uncomfortable, which shows
        that there has been a suffusion of blood on the brain. The third attack
        will either carry me off, or leave me paralyzed for life.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried Dantès; &ldquo;you are mistaken&mdash;you will
        not die! And your third attack (if, indeed, you should have another) will
        find you at liberty. We shall save you another time, as we have done this,
        only with a better chance of success, because we shall be able to command
        every requisite assistance.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My good Edmond,&rdquo; answered the abbé, &ldquo;be not deceived.
        The attack which has just passed away, condemns me forever to the walls of
        a prison. None can fly from a dungeon who cannot walk.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, we will wait,&mdash;a week, a month, two months, if need be,&mdash;and
        meanwhile your strength will return. Everything is in readiness for our
        flight, and we can select any time we choose. As soon as you feel able to
        swim we will go.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall never swim again,&rdquo; replied Faria. &ldquo;This arm is
        paralyzed; not for a time, but forever. Lift it, and judge if I am
        mistaken.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The young man raised the arm, which fell back by its own weight, perfectly
        inanimate and helpless. A sigh escaped him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are convinced now, Edmond, are you not?&rdquo; asked the abbé.
        &ldquo;Depend upon it, I know what I say. Since the first attack I
        experienced of this malady, I have continually reflected on it. Indeed, I
        expected it, for it is a family inheritance; both my father and
        grandfather died of it in a third attack. The physician who prepared for
        me the remedy I have twice successfully taken, was no other than the
        celebrated Cabanis, and he predicted a similar end for me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0233m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The physician may be mistaken!&rdquo; exclaimed Dantès. &ldquo;And
        as for your poor arm, what difference will that make? I can take you on my
        shoulders, and swim for both of us.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My son,&rdquo; said the abbé, &ldquo;you, who are a sailor and a
        swimmer, must know as well as I do that a man so loaded would sink before
        he had done fifty strokes. Cease, then, to allow yourself to be duped by
        vain hopes, that even your own excellent heart refuses to believe in. Here
        I shall remain till the hour of my deliverance arrives, and that, in all
        human probability, will be the hour of my death. As for you, who are young
        and active, delay not on my account, but fly&mdash;go&mdash;I give you
        back your promise.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said Dantès. &ldquo;Then I shall also remain.&rdquo;
        Then, rising and extending his hand with an air of solemnity over the old
        man&rsquo;s head, he slowly added, &ldquo;By the blood of Christ I swear
        never to leave you while you live.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Faria gazed fondly on his noble-minded, single-hearted, high-principled
        young friend, and read in his countenance ample confirmation of the
        sincerity of his devotion and the loyalty of his purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; murmured the invalid, extending one hand. &ldquo;I
        accept. You may one of these days reap the reward of your disinterested
        devotion. But as I cannot, and you will not, quit this place, it becomes
        necessary to fill up the excavation beneath the soldier&rsquo;s gallery;
        he might, by chance, hear the hollow sound of his footsteps, and call the
        attention of his officer to the circumstance. That would bring about a
        discovery which would inevitably lead to our being separated. Go, then,
        and set about this work, in which, unhappily, I can offer you no
        assistance; keep at it all night, if necessary, and do not return here
        tomorrow till after the jailer has visited me. I shall have something of
        the greatest importance to communicate to you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Dantès took the hand of the abbé in his, and affectionately pressed it.
        Faria smiled encouragingly on him, and the young man retired to his task,
        in the spirit of obedience and respect which he had sworn to show towards
        his aged friend.
