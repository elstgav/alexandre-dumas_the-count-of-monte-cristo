      <h2>Chapter 101. Locusta</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">V</span>alentine was
        alone; two other clocks, slower than that of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule,
        struck the hour of midnight from different directions, and excepting the
        rumbling of a few carriages all was silent. Then Valentine&rsquo;s
        attention was engrossed by the clock in her room, which marked the
        seconds. She began counting them, remarking that they were much slower
        than the beatings of her heart; and still she doubted,&mdash;the
        inoffensive Valentine could not imagine that anyone should desire her
        death. Why should they? To what end? What had she done to excite the
        malice of an enemy?
      </p>
      <p>
        There was no fear of her falling asleep. One terrible idea pressed upon
        her mind,&mdash;that someone existed in the world who had attempted to
        assassinate her, and who was about to endeavor to do so again. Supposing
        this person, wearied at the inefficacy of the poison, should, as Monte
        Cristo intimated, have recourse to steel!&mdash;What if the count should
        have no time to run to her rescue!&mdash;What if her last moments were
        approaching, and she should never again see Morrel!
      </p>
      <p>
        When this terrible chain of ideas presented itself, Valentine was nearly
        persuaded to ring the bell, and call for help. But through the door she
        fancied she saw the luminous eye of the count&mdash;that eye which lived
        in her memory, and the recollection overwhelmed her with so much shame
        that she asked herself whether any amount of gratitude could ever repay
        his adventurous and devoted friendship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Twenty minutes, twenty tedious minutes, passed thus, then ten more, and at
        last the clock struck the half-hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just then the sound of finger-nails slightly grating against the door of the
        library informed Valentine that the count was still watching, and recommended her
        to do the same; at the same time, on the opposite side, that is towards
        Edward&rsquo;s room, Valentine fancied that she heard the creaking of the floor;
        she listened attentively, holding her breath till she was nearly suffocated; the
        lock turned, and the door slowly opened. Valentine had raised herself upon her
        elbow, and had scarcely time to throw herself down on the bed and shade
        her eyes with her arm; then, trembling, agitated, and her heart beating
        with indescribable terror, she awaited the event.
      </p>
      <p>
        Someone approached the bed and drew back the curtains. Valentine summoned
        every effort, and breathed with that regular respiration which announces
        tranquil sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Valentine!&rdquo; said a low voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The girl shuddered to the heart but did not reply.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Valentine,&rdquo; repeated the same voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still silent: Valentine had promised not to wake. Then everything was still,
        excepting that Valentine heard the almost noiseless sound of some liquid being
        poured into the glass she had just emptied. Then she ventured to open her
        eyelids, and glance over her extended arm. She saw a woman in a white
        dressing-gown pouring a liquor from a phial into her glass. During this
        short time Valentine must have held her breath, or moved in some slight
        degree, for the woman, disturbed, stopped and leaned over the bed, in
        order the better to ascertain whether Valentine slept: it was Madame
        de Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        On recognizing her step-mother, Valentine could not repress a shudder,
        which caused a vibration in the bed. Madame de Villefort instantly stepped
        back close to the wall, and there, shaded by the bed-curtains, she
        silently and attentively watched the slightest movement of Valentine. The
        latter recollected the terrible caution of Monte Cristo; she fancied that
        the hand not holding the phial clasped a long sharp knife. Then collecting
        all her remaining strength, she forced herself to close her eyes; but this
        simple operation upon the most delicate organs of our frame, generally so
        easy to accomplish, became almost impossible at this moment, so much did
        curiosity struggle to retain the eyelid open and learn the truth. Madame
        de Villefort, however, reassured by the silence, which was alone disturbed
        by the regular breathing of Valentine, again extended her hand, and half
        hidden by the curtains succeeded in emptying the contents of the phial
        into the glass. Then she retired so gently that Valentine did not know she
        had left the room. She only witnessed the withdrawal of the arm&mdash;the
        fair round arm of a woman but twenty-five years old, and who yet spread
        death around her.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50077m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        It is impossible to describe the sensations experienced by Valentine
        during the minute and a half Madame de Villefort remained in the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        The grating against the library-door aroused the young girl from the stupor in
        which she was plunged, and which almost amounted to insensibility. She
        raised her head with an effort. The noiseless door again turned on its
        hinges, and the Count of Monte Cristo reappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you still doubt?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; murmured the young girl.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you seen?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you recognize?&rdquo; Valentine groaned.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes;&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I saw, but I cannot believe!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Would you rather die, then, and cause Maximilian&rsquo;s death?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; repeated the young girl, almost bewildered, &ldquo;can I
        not leave the house?&mdash;can I not escape?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Valentine, the hand which now threatens you will pursue you
        everywhere; your servants will be seduced with gold, and death will be
        offered to you disguised in every shape. You will find it in the water you
        drink from the spring, in the fruit you pluck from the tree.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But did you not say that my kind grandfather&rsquo;s precaution had
        neutralized the poison?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but not against a strong dose; the poison will be changed, and
        the quantity increased.&rdquo; He took the glass and raised it to his
        lips. &ldquo;It is already done,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;brucine is no
        longer employed, but a simple narcotic! I can recognize the flavor of the
        alcohol in which it has been dissolved. If you had taken what Madame de
        Villefort has poured into your glass, Valentine&mdash;Valentine&mdash;you
        would have been doomed!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; exclaimed the young girl, &ldquo;why am I thus pursued?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why?&mdash;are you so kind&mdash;so good&mdash;so unsuspicious of
        ill, that you cannot understand, Valentine?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I have never injured her.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But you are rich, Valentine; you have 200,000 livres a year, and
        you prevent her son from enjoying these 200,000 livres.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How so? The fortune is not her gift, but is inherited from my
        relations.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly; and that is why M. and Madame de Saint-Méran have died;
        that is why M. Noirtier was sentenced the day he made you his heir; that
        is why you, in your turn, are to die&mdash;it is because your father would
        inherit your property, and your brother, his only son, succeed to his.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Edward? Poor child! Are all these crimes committed on his account?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, then you at length understand?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Heaven grant that this may not be visited upon him!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Valentine, you are an angel!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But why is my grandfather allowed to live?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It was considered, that you dead, the fortune would naturally
        revert to your brother, unless he were disinherited; and besides, the
        crime appearing useless, it would be folly to commit it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And is it possible that this frightful combination of crimes has
        been invented by a woman?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you recollect in the arbor of the Hôtel des Postes, at Perugia,
        seeing a man in a brown cloak, whom your stepmother was questioning upon
        <i>aqua tofana</i>? Well, ever since then, the infernal project has been
        ripening in her brain.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, then, indeed, sir,&rdquo; said the sweet girl, bathed in tears,
        &ldquo;I see that I am condemned to die!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, Valentine, for I have foreseen all their plots; no, your enemy
        is conquered since we know her, and you will live, Valentine&mdash;live to
        be happy yourself, and to confer happiness upon a noble heart; but to
        insure this you must rely on me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Command me, sir&mdash;what am I to do?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You must blindly take what I give you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas, were it only for my own sake, I should prefer to die!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You must not confide in anyone&mdash;not even in your father.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My father is not engaged in this fearful plot, is he, sir?&rdquo;
        asked Valentine, clasping her hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; and yet your father, a man accustomed to judicial accusations,
        ought to have known that all these deaths have not happened naturally; it
        is he who should have watched over you&mdash;he should have occupied my
        place&mdash;he should have emptied that glass&mdash;he should have risen
        against the assassin. Spectre against spectre!&rdquo; he murmured in a low
        voice, as he concluded his sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Valentine, &ldquo;I will do all I can to live, for
        there are two beings who love me and will die if I die&mdash;my
        grandfather and Maximilian.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will watch over them as I have over you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, sir, do as you will with me;&rdquo; and then she added, in a
        low voice, &ldquo;oh, heavens, what will befall me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Whatever may happen, Valentine, do not be alarmed; though you
        suffer; though you lose sight, hearing, consciousness, fear nothing;
        though you should awake and be ignorant where you are, still do not fear;
        even though you should find yourself in a sepulchral vault or coffin.
        Reassure yourself, then, and say to yourself: &lsquo;At this moment, a
        friend, a father, who lives for my happiness and that of Maximilian,
        watches over me!&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas, alas, what a fearful extremity!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Valentine, would you rather denounce your stepmother?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I would rather die a hundred times&mdash;oh, yes, die!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, you will not die; but will you promise me, whatever happens,
        that you will not complain, but hope?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will think of Maximilian!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are my own darling child, Valentine! I alone can save you, and
        I will.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine in the extremity of her terror joined her hands,&mdash;for she felt that
        the moment had arrived to ask for courage,&mdash;and began to pray, and while
        uttering little more than incoherent words, she forgot that her white shoulders
        had no other covering than her long hair, and that the pulsations of her heart
        could be seen through the lace of her nightdress. Monte Cristo gently laid his
        hand on the young girl&rsquo;s arm, drew the velvet coverlet close to her throat,
        and said with a paternal smile:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My child, believe in my devotion to you as you believe in the goodness of
        Providence and the love of Maximilian.&rdquo; Valentine gave him a look full of
        gratitude, and remained as docile as a child.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he drew from his waistcoat-pocket the little emerald box, raised the
        golden lid, and took from it a pastille about the size of a pea, which he
        placed in her hand. She took it, and looked attentively on the count;
        there was an expression on the face of her intrepid protector which
        commanded her veneration. She evidently interrogated him by her look.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he.
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine carried the pastille to her mouth, and swallowed it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And now, my dear child, adieu for the present. I will try and gain a
        little sleep, for you are saved.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Go,&rdquo; said Valentine, &ldquo;whatever happens, I promise you
        not to fear.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo for some time kept his eyes fixed on the young girl, who
        gradually fell asleep, yielding to the effects of the narcotic the count
        had given her. Then he took the glass, emptied three parts of the contents
        in the fireplace, that it might be supposed Valentine had taken it, and
        replaced it on the table; then he disappeared, after throwing a farewell
        glance on Valentine, who slept with the confidence and innocence of an
        angel at the feet of the Lord.
