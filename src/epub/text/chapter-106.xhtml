      <h2>Chapter 106. Dividing the Proceeds</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he apartment on
        the first floor of the house in the Rue Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s, where
        Albert de Morcerf had selected a home for his mother, was let to a very
        mysterious person. This was a man whose face the concierge himself had
        never seen, for in the winter his chin was buried in one of the large red
        handkerchiefs worn by gentlemen&rsquo;s coachmen on a cold night, and in
        the summer he made a point of always blowing his nose just as he
        approached the door. Contrary to custom, this gentleman had not been
        watched, for as the report ran that he was a person of high rank, and one
        who would allow no impertinent interference, his <i>incognito</i> was
        strictly respected.
      </p>
      <p>
        His visits were tolerably regular, though occasionally he appeared a
        little before or after his time, but generally, both in summer and winter,
        he took possession of his apartment about four o&rsquo;clock, though he
        never spent the night there. At half-past three in the winter the fire was
        lighted by the discreet servant, who had the superintendence of the little
        apartment, and in the summer ices were placed on the table at the same
        hour. At four o&rsquo;clock, as we have already stated, the mysterious
        personage arrived.
      </p>
      <p>
        Twenty minutes afterwards a carriage stopped at the house, a lady alighted in a
        black or dark blue dress, and always thickly veiled; she passed like a shadow
        through the lodge, and ran upstairs without a sound escaping under the touch of
        her light foot. No one ever asked her where she was going. Her face, therefore,
        like that of the gentleman, was perfectly unknown to the two concierges, who
        were perhaps unequalled throughout the capital for discretion. We need not say
        she stopped at the first floor. Then she tapped in a peculiar manner at a
        door, which after being opened to admit her was again fastened, and
        curiosity penetrated no farther. They used the same precautions in leaving
        as in entering the house. The lady always left first, and as soon as she
        had stepped into her carriage, it drove away, sometimes towards the right
        hand, sometimes to the left; then about twenty minutes afterwards the
        gentleman would also leave, buried in his cravat or concealed by his
        handkerchief.
      </p>
      <p>
        The day after Monte Cristo had called upon Danglars, the mysterious lodger
        entered at ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning instead of four in the
        afternoon. Almost directly afterwards, without the usual interval of time,
        a cab arrived, and the veiled lady ran hastily upstairs. The door opened,
        but before it could be closed, the lady exclaimed:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, Lucien&mdash;oh, my friend!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The concierge therefore heard for the first time that the lodger&rsquo;s name was
        Lucien; still, as he was the very perfection of a door-keeper, he made up his
        mind not to tell his wife.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what is the matter, my dear?&rdquo; asked the gentleman whose
        name the lady&rsquo;s agitation revealed; &ldquo;tell me what is the matter.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, Lucien, can I confide in you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course, you know you can do so. But what can be the matter? Your
        note of this morning has completely bewildered me. This precipitation&mdash;this
        unusual appointment. Come, ease me of my anxiety, or else frighten me at
        once.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Lucien, a great event has happened!&rdquo; said the lady, glancing
        inquiringly at Lucien,&mdash;&ldquo;M. Danglars left last night!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Left?&mdash;M. Danglars left? Where has he gone?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you mean? Has he gone intending not to return?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Undoubtedly;&mdash;at ten o&rsquo;clock at night his horses took
        him to the barrier of Charenton; there a post-chaise was waiting for him&mdash;he
        entered it with his valet de chambre, saying that he was going to
        Fontainebleau.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then what did you mean&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Stay&mdash;he left a letter for me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A letter?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; read it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And the baroness took from her pocket a letter which she gave to Debray. Debray
        paused a moment before reading, as if trying to guess its contents, or perhaps
        while making up his mind how to act, whatever it might contain. No doubt his
        ideas were arranged in a few minutes, for he began reading the letter which
        caused so much uneasiness in the heart of the baroness, and which ran as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Madame and most faithful wife.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Debray mechanically stopped and looked at the baroness, whose face became
        covered with blushes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Read,&rdquo; she said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Debray continued:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;When you receive this, you will no longer have a husband. Oh, you
        need not be alarmed, you will only have lost him as you have lost your
        daughter; I mean that I shall be travelling on one of the thirty or forty
        roads leading out of France. I owe you some explanations for my conduct,
        and as you are a woman that can perfectly understand me, I will give them.
        Listen, then. I received this morning five millions which I paid away;
        almost directly afterwards another demand for the same sum was presented
        to me; I put this creditor off till tomorrow and I intend leaving today,
        to escape that tomorrow, which would be rather too unpleasant for me to
        endure. You understand this, do you not, my most precious wife? I say you
        understand this, because you are as conversant with my affairs as I am;
        indeed, I think you understand them better, since I am ignorant of what
        has become of a considerable portion of my fortune, once very tolerable,
        while I am sure, madame, that you know perfectly well. For women have
        infallible instincts; they can even explain the marvellous by an algebraic
        calculation they have invented; but I, who only understand my own figures,
        know nothing more than that one day these figures deceived me. Have you
        admired the rapidity of my fall? Have you been slightly dazzled at the
        sudden fusion of my ingots? I confess I have seen nothing but the fire;
        let us hope you have found some gold among the ashes. With this consoling
        idea, I leave you, madame, and most prudent wife, without any
        conscientious reproach for abandoning you; you have friends left, and the
        ashes I have already mentioned, and above all the liberty I hasten to
        restore to you. And here, madame, I must add another word of explanation.
        So long as I hoped you were working for the good of our house and for the
        fortune of our daughter, I philosophically closed my eyes; but as you have
        transformed that house into a vast ruin I will not be the foundation of
        another man&rsquo;s fortune. You were rich when I married you, but little
        respected. Excuse me for speaking so very candidly, but as this is
        intended only for ourselves, I do not see why I should weigh my words. I
        have augmented our fortune, and it has continued to increase during the
        last fifteen years, till extraordinary and unexpected catastrophes have
        suddenly overturned it,&mdash;without any fault of mine, I can honestly
        declare. You, madame, have only sought to increase your own, and I am
        convinced that you have succeeded. I leave you, therefore, as I took you,&mdash;rich,
        but little respected. Adieu! I also intend from this time to work on my
        own account. Accept my acknowledgments for the example you have set me,
        and which I intend following.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Your very devoted husband,
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Baron Danglars.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The baroness had watched Debray while he read this long and painful
        letter, and saw him, notwithstanding his self-control, change color once
        or twice. When he had ended the perusal, he folded the letter and resumed
        his pensive attitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Madame Danglars, with an anxiety easy to be understood.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, madame?&rdquo; unhesitatingly repeated Debray.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With what ideas does that letter inspire you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, it is simple enough, madame; it inspires me with the idea that
        M. Danglars has left suspiciously.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly; but is this all you have to say to me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not understand you,&rdquo; said Debray with freezing coldness.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is gone! Gone, never to return!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, madame, do not think that!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I tell you he will never return. I know his character; he is
        inflexible in any resolutions formed for his own interests. If he could
        have made any use of me, he would have taken me with him; he leaves me in
        Paris, as our separation will conduce to his benefit;&mdash;therefore he
        has gone, and I am free forever,&rdquo; added Madame Danglars, in the same
        supplicating tone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Debray, instead of answering, allowed her to remain in an attitude of nervous
        inquiry.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she said at length, &ldquo;do you not answer me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have but one question to ask you,&mdash;what do you intend to do?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I was going to ask you,&rdquo; replied the baroness with a beating
        heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, then, you wish to ask advice of me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; I do wish to ask your advice,&rdquo; said Madame Danglars with
        anxious expectation.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then if you wish to take my advice,&rdquo; said the young man
        coldly, &ldquo;I would recommend you to travel.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To travel!&rdquo; she murmured.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly; as M. Danglars says, you are rich, and perfectly free.
        In my opinion, a withdrawal from Paris is absolutely necessary after the
        double catastrophe of Mademoiselle Danglars&rsquo; broken contract and M.
        Danglars&rsquo; disappearance. The world will think you abandoned and
        poor, for the wife of a bankrupt would never be forgiven, were she to keep
        up an appearance of opulence. You have only to remain in Paris for about a
        fortnight, telling the world you are abandoned, and relating the details
        of this desertion to your best friends, who will soon spread the report.
        Then you can quit your house, leaving your jewels and giving up your
        jointure, and everyone&rsquo;s mouth will be filled with praises of your
        disinterestedness. They will know you are deserted, and think you also
        poor, for I alone know your real financial position, and am quite ready to
        give up my accounts as an honest partner.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The dread with which the pale and motionless baroness listened to this, was
        equalled by the calm indifference with which Debray had spoken.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Deserted?&rdquo; she repeated; &ldquo;ah, yes, I am, indeed, deserted!
        You are right, sir, and no one can doubt my position.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        These were the only words that this proud and violently enamoured woman could
        utter in response to Debray.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50137m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But then you are rich,&mdash;very rich, indeed,&rdquo; continued
        Debray, taking out some papers from his pocket-book, which he spread upon
        the table. Madame Danglars did not see them; she was engaged in stilling
        the beatings of her heart, and restraining the tears which were ready to
        gush forth. At length a sense of dignity prevailed, and if she did not
        entirely master her agitation, she at least succeeded in preventing the
        fall of a single tear.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; said Debray, &ldquo;it is nearly six months since we have
        been associated. You furnished a principal of 100,000 francs. Our partnership
        began in the month of April. In May we commenced operations, and in the course
        of the month gained 450,000 francs. In June the profit amounted to 900,000. In
        July we added 1,700,000 francs,&mdash;it was, you know, the month of the Spanish
        bonds. In August we lost 300,000 francs at the beginning of the month, but on
        the 13th we made up for it, and we now find that our accounts, reckoning from
        the first day of partnership up to yesterday, when I closed them, showed a
        capital of 2,400,000 francs, that is, 1,200,000 for each of us. Now,
        madame,&rdquo; said Debray, delivering up his accounts in the methodical
        manner of a stockbroker, &ldquo;there are still 80,000 francs, the
        interest of this money, in my hands.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the baroness, &ldquo;I thought you never put the
        money out to interest.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Excuse me, madame,&rdquo; said Debray coldly, &ldquo;I had your
        permission to do so, and I have made use of it. There are, then, 40,000
        francs for your share, besides the 100,000 you furnished me to begin with,
        making in all 1,340,000 francs for your portion. Now, madame, I took the
        precaution of drawing out your money the day before yesterday; it is not
        long ago, you see, and I was in continual expectation of being called on
        to deliver up my accounts. There is your money,&mdash;half in bank-notes,
        the other half in checks payable to bearer. I say <i>there</i>, for as I
        did not consider my house safe enough, or lawyers sufficiently discreet,
        and as landed property carries evidence with it, and moreover since you
        have no right to possess anything independent of your husband, I have kept
        this sum, now your whole fortune, in a chest concealed under that closet,
        and for greater security I myself concealed it there.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now, madame,&rdquo; continued Debray, first opening the closet,
        then the chest;&mdash;&ldquo;now, madame, here are 800 notes of 1,000
        francs each, resembling, as you see, a large book bound in iron; to this I
        add a certificate in the funds of 25,000 francs; then, for the odd cash,
        making I think about 110,000 francs, here is a check upon my banker, who,
        not being M. Danglars, will pay you the amount, you may rest assured.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Danglars mechanically took the check, the bond, and the heap of
        bank-notes. This enormous fortune made no great appearance on the table.
        Madame Danglars, with tearless eyes, but with her breast heaving with
        concealed emotion, placed the bank-notes in her bag, put the certificate
        and check into her pocket-book, and then, standing pale and mute, awaited
        one kind word of consolation.
      </p>
      <p>
        But she waited in vain.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now, madame,&rdquo; said Debray, &ldquo;you have a splendid
        fortune, an income of about 60,000 livres a year, which is enormous for a
        woman who cannot keep an establishment here for a year, at least. You will
        be able to indulge all your fancies; besides, should you find your income
        insufficient, you can, for the sake of the past, madame, make use of mine;
        and I am ready to offer you all I possess, on loan.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you, sir&mdash;thank you,&rdquo; replied the baroness;
        &ldquo;you forget that what you have just paid me is much more than a poor
        woman requires, who intends for some time, at least, to retire from the
        world.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Debray was, for a moment, surprised, but immediately recovering himself,
        he bowed with an air which seemed to say, &ldquo;As you please, madame.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Danglars had until then, perhaps, hoped for something; but when she
        saw the careless bow of Debray, and the glance by which it was
        accompanied, together with his significant silence, she raised her head,
        and without passion or violence or even hesitation, ran downstairs,
        disdaining to address a last farewell to one who could thus part from her.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bah,&rdquo; said Debray, when she had left, &ldquo;these are fine
        projects! She will remain at home, read novels, and speculate at cards,
        since she can no longer do so on the Bourse.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Then taking up his account book, he cancelled with the greatest care all the
        entries of the amounts he had just paid away.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have 1,060,000 francs remaining,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What a pity
        Mademoiselle de Villefort is dead! She suited me in every respect, and I would
        have married her.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And he calmly waited until the twenty minutes had elapsed after Madame
        Danglars&rsquo; departure before he left the house. During this time he occupied
        himself in making figures, with his watch by his side.
      </p>
      <p>
        Asmodeus&mdash;that diabolical personage, who would have been created by
        every fertile imagination if Le Sage had not acquired the priority in his
        great masterpiece&mdash;would have enjoyed a singular spectacle, if he had
        lifted up the roof of the little house in the Rue Saint-Germain-des-Pr√©s,
        while Debray was casting up his figures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Above the room in which Debray had been dividing two millions and a half with
        Madame Danglars was another, inhabited by persons who have played too prominent
        a part in the incidents we have related for their appearance not to create some
        interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Merc√©d√®s and Albert were in that room.
      </p>
      <p>
        Merc√©d√®s was much changed within the last few days; not that even in her days of
        fortune she had ever dressed with the magnificent display which makes us no longer
        able to recognize a woman when she appears in a plain and simple attire; nor
        indeed, had she fallen into that state of depression where it is
        impossible to conceal the garb of misery; no, the change in Merc√©d√®s was
        that her eye no longer sparkled, her lips no longer smiled, and there was
        now a hesitation in uttering the words which formerly sprang so fluently
        from her ready wit.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was not poverty which had broken her spirit; it was not a want of
        courage which rendered her poverty burdensome. Merc√©d√®s, although deposed
        from the exalted position she had occupied, lost in the sphere she had now
        chosen, like a person passing from a room splendidly lighted into utter
        darkness, appeared like a queen, fallen from her palace to a hovel, and
        who, reduced to strict necessity, could neither become reconciled to the
        earthen vessels she was herself forced to place upon the table, nor to the
        humble pallet which had become her bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The beautiful Catalane and noble countess had lost both her proud glance and
        charming smile, because she saw nothing but misery around her; the walls were
        hung with one of the gray papers which economical landlords choose as not likely
        to show the dirt; the floor was uncarpeted; the furniture attracted the attention
        to the poor attempt at luxury; indeed, everything offended eyes accustomed to
        refinement and elegance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame de Morcerf had lived there since leaving her house; the continual
        silence of the spot oppressed her; still, seeing that Albert continually
        watched her countenance to judge the state of her feelings, she
        constrained herself to assume a monotonous smile of the lips alone, which,
        contrasted with the sweet and beaming expression that usually shone from
        her eyes, seemed like &ldquo;moonlight on a statue,&rdquo;&mdash;yielding
        light without warmth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Albert, too, was ill at ease; the remains of luxury prevented him from sinking
        into his actual position. If he wished to go out without gloves, his hands appeared
        too white; if he wished to walk through the town, his boots seemed too highly
        polished. Yet these two noble and intelligent creatures, united by the indissoluble
        ties of maternal and filial love, had succeeded in tacitly understanding one
        another, and economizing their stores, and Albert had been able to tell
        his mother without extorting a change of countenance:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mother, we have no more money.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50141m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        Merc√©d√®s had never known misery; she had often, in her youth, spoken of
        poverty, but between want and necessity, those synonymous words, there is
        a wide difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amongst the Catalans, Merc√©d√®s wished for a thousand things, but still she never
        really wanted any. So long as the nets were good, they caught fish; and so long
        as they sold their fish, they were able to buy twine for new nets. And then,
        shut out from friendship, having but one affection, which could not be mixed up
        with her ordinary pursuits, she thought of herself&mdash;of no one but herself.
        Upon the little she earned she lived as well as she could; now there were two
        to be supported, and nothing to live upon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Winter approached. Merc√©d√®s had no fire in that cold and naked room&mdash;she,
        who was accustomed to stoves which heated the house from the hall to the
        boudoir; she had not even one little flower&mdash;she whose apartment had
        been a conservatory of costly exotics. But she had her son. Hitherto the
        excitement of fulfilling a duty had sustained them. Excitement, like
        enthusiasm, sometimes renders us unconscious to the things of earth. But
        the excitement had calmed down, and they felt themselves obliged to
        descend from dreams to reality; after having exhausted the ideal, they
        found they must talk of the actual.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; exclaimed Albert, just as Madame Danglars was
        descending the stairs, &ldquo;let us reckon our riches, if you please; I
        want capital to build my plans upon.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Capital&mdash;nothing!&rdquo; replied Merc√©d√®s with a mournful
        smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, mother,&mdash;capital 3,000 francs. And I have an idea of our
        leading a delightful life upon this 3,000 francs.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Child!&rdquo; sighed Merc√©d√®s.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas, dear mother,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;I have
        unhappily spent too much of your money not to know the value of it. These
        3,000 francs are enormous, and I intend building upon this foundation a
        miraculous certainty for the future.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You say this, my dear boy; but do you think we ought to accept
        these 3,000 francs?&rdquo; said Merc√©d√®s, coloring.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; answered Albert in a firm tone. &ldquo;We will
        accept them the more readily, since we have them not here; you know they
        are buried in the garden of the little house in the All√©es de Meilhan, at
        Marseilles. With 200 francs we can reach Marseilles.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With 200 francs?&mdash;are you sure, Albert?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, as for that, I have made inquiries respecting the diligences
        and steamboats, and my calculations are made. You will take your place in
        the <i>coup√©</i> to Ch√¢lons. You see, mother, I treat you handsomely for
        thirty-five francs.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Albert then took a pen, and wrote:
      </p>
      <pre xml:space="preserve">
                                                           Frs.
        <i>Coup√©</i>, thirty-five francs.............................. 35.
        From Ch√¢lons to Lyons you will go on by the steamboat..  6.
        From Lyons to Avignon (still by steamboat)............. 16.
        From Avignon to Marseilles, seven francs...............  7.
        Expenses on the road, about fifty francs............... 50.
        Total................................................. 114 frs.
      </pre>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us put down 120,&rdquo; added Albert, smiling. &ldquo;You see I
        am generous, am I not, mother?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But you, my poor child?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I? do you not see that I reserve eighty francs for myself? A young
        man does not require luxuries; besides, I know what travelling is.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With a post-chaise and valet de chambre?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Any way, mother.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, be it so. But these 200 francs?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Here they are, and 200 more besides. See, I have sold my watch for
        100 francs, and the guard and seals for 300. How fortunate that the
        ornaments were worth more than the watch. Still the same story of
        superfluities! Now I think we are rich, since instead of the 114 francs we
        require for the journey we find ourselves in possession of 250.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But we owe something in this house?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thirty francs; but I pay that out of my 150 francs,&mdash;that is
        understood,&mdash;and as I require only eighty francs for my journey, you
        see I am overwhelmed with luxury. But that is not all. What do you say to
        this, mother?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And Albert took out of a little pocket-book with golden clasps, a remnant
        of his old fancies, or perhaps a tender souvenir from one of the
        mysterious and veiled ladies who used to knock at his little door,&mdash;Albert
        took out of this pocket-book a note of 1,000 francs.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; asked Merc√©d√®s.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A thousand francs.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But whence have you obtained them?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen to me, mother, and do not yield too much to agitation.&rdquo;
        And Albert, rising, kissed his mother on both cheeks, then stood looking
        at her. &ldquo;You cannot imagine, mother, how beautiful I think you!&rdquo;
        said the young man, impressed with a profound feeling of filial love.
        &ldquo;You are, indeed, the most beautiful and most noble woman I ever
        saw!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Dear child!&rdquo; said Merc√©d√®s, endeavoring in vain to restrain a
        tear which glistened in the corner of her eye. &ldquo;Indeed, you only
        wanted misfortune to change my love for you to admiration. I am not
        unhappy while I possess my son!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, just so,&rdquo; said Albert; &ldquo;here begins the trial. Do
        you know the decision we have come to, mother?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have we come to any?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; it is decided that you are to live at Marseilles, and that I
        am to leave for Africa, where I will earn for myself the right to use the
        name I now bear, instead of the one I have thrown aside.&rdquo; Merc√©d√®s
        sighed. &ldquo;Well, mother, I yesterday engaged myself as substitute in the
        Spahis,&rdquo;<a href="#linknote-25" name="linknoteref-25" id="linknoteref-25">25</a>
        added the young man, lowering his eyes with a certain feeling of shame, for
        even he was unconscious of the sublimity of his self-abasement. &ldquo;I thought
        my body was my own, and that I might sell it. I yesterday took the place of
        another. I sold myself for more than I thought I was worth,&rdquo; he added,
        attempting to smile; &ldquo;I fetched 2,000 francs.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then these 1,000 francs&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said Merc√©d√®s,
        shuddering.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are the half of the sum, mother; the other will be paid in a year.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Merc√©d√®s raised her eyes to heaven with an expression it would be
        impossible to describe, and tears, which had hitherto been restrained, now
        yielded to her emotion, and ran down her cheeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The price of his blood!&rdquo; she murmured.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, if I am killed,&rdquo; said Albert, laughing. &ldquo;But I
        assure you, mother, I have a strong intention of defending my person, and
        I never felt half so strong an inclination to live as I do now.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Merciful Heavens!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Besides, mother, why should you make up your mind that I am to be
        killed? Has Lamorici√®re, that Ney of the South, been killed? Has
        Changarnier been killed? Has Bedeau been killed? Has Morrel, whom we know,
        been killed? Think of your joy, mother, when you see me return with an
        embroidered uniform! I declare, I expect to look magnificent in it, and
        chose that regiment only from vanity.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Merc√©d√®s sighed while endeavoring to smile; the devoted mother felt that she ought
        not to allow the whole weight of the sacrifice to fall upon her son.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, now you understand, mother!&rdquo; continued Albert; &ldquo;here are
        more than 4,000 francs settled on you; upon these you can live at least
        two years.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; said Merc√©d√®s.
      </p>
      <p>
        These words were uttered inso mournful a tone that their real meaning did not
        escape Albert; he felt his heart beat, and taking his mother&rsquo;s hand
        within his own he said, tenderly:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, you will live!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall live!&mdash;then you will not leave me, Albert?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mother, I must go,&rdquo; said Albert in a firm, calm voice;
        &ldquo;you love me too well to wish me to remain useless and idle with
        you; besides, I have signed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50145m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You will obey your own wish and the will of Heaven!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not my own wish, mother, but reason&mdash;necessity. Are we not two
        despairing creatures? What is life to you?&mdash;Nothing. What is life to
        me?&mdash;Very little without you, mother; for believe me, but for you I
        should have ceased to live on the day I doubted my father and renounced
        his name. Well, I will live, if you promise me still to hope; and if you
        grant me the care of your future prospects, you will redouble my strength.
        Then I will go to the governor of Algeria; he has a royal heart, and is
        essentially a soldier; I will tell him my gloomy story. I will beg him to
        turn his eyes now and then towards me, and if he keep his word and
        interest himself for me, in six months I shall be an officer, or dead. If
        I am an officer, your fortune is certain, for I shall have money enough
        for both, and, moreover, a name we shall both be proud of, since it will
        be our own. If I am killed&mdash;well then mother, you can also die, and
        there will be an end of our misfortunes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; replied Merc√©d√®s, with her eloquent glance;
        &ldquo;you are right, my love; let us prove to those who are watching our
        actions that we are worthy of compassion.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But let us not yield to gloomy apprehensions,&rdquo; said the young
        man; &ldquo;I assure you we are, or rather we shall be, very happy. You
        are a woman at once full of spirit and resignation; I have become simple
        in my tastes, and am without passion, I hope. Once in service, I shall be
        rich&mdash;once in M. Dant√®s&rsquo; house, you will be at rest. Let us
        strive, I beseech you,&mdash;let us strive to be cheerful.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, let us strive, for you ought to live, and to be happy, Albert.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And so our division is made, mother,&rdquo; said the young man,
        affecting ease of mind. &ldquo;We can now part; come, I shall engage your
        passage.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you, my dear boy?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall stay here for a few days longer; we must accustom ourselves
        to parting. I want recommendations and some information relative to
        Africa. I will join you again at Marseilles.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, be it so&mdash;let us part,&rdquo; said Merc√©d√®s, folding
        around her shoulders the only shawl she had taken away, and which
        accidentally happened to be a valuable black cashmere. Albert gathered up
        his papers hastily, rang the bell to pay the thirty francs he owed to the
        landlord, and offering his arm to his mother, they descended the stairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Someone was walking down before them, and this person, hearing the rustling of
        a silk dress, turned around. &ldquo;Debray!&rdquo; muttered Albert.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You, Morcerf?&rdquo; replied the secretary, resting on the stairs.
        Curiosity had vanquished the desire of preserving his <i>incognito</i>,
        and he was recognized. It was, indeed, strange in this unknown spot to
        find the young man whose misfortunes had made so much noise in Paris.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Morcerf!&rdquo; repeated Debray. Then noticing in the dim light the
        still youthful and veiled figure of Madame de Morcerf:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; he added with a smile, &ldquo;I leave you, Albert.&rdquo;
        Albert understood his thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; he said, turning towards Merc√©d√®s, &ldquo;this is M.
        Debray, secretary of the Minister for the Interior, once a friend of mine.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How once?&rdquo; stammered Debray; &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I say so, M. Debray, because I have no friends now, and I ought not
        to have any. I thank you for having recognized me, sir.&rdquo; Debray
        stepped forward, and cordially pressed the hand of his interlocutor.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Believe me, dear Albert,&rdquo; he said, with all the emotion he
        was capable of feeling,&mdash;&ldquo;believe me, I feel deeply for your
        misfortunes, and if in any way I can serve you, I am yours.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you, sir,&rdquo; said Albert, smiling. &ldquo;In the midst of
        our misfortunes, we are still rich enough not to require assistance from
        anyone. We are leaving Paris, and when our journey is paid, we shall have
        5,000 francs left.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The blood mounted to the temples of Debray, who held a million in his pocket-book,
        and unimaginative as he was he could not help reflecting that the same house had
        contained two women, one of whom, justly dishonored, had left it poor with
        1,500,000 francs under her cloak, while the other, unjustly stricken, but sublime
        in her misfortune, was yet rich with a few deniers. This parallel disturbed his
        usual politeness, the philosophy he witnessed appalled him, he muttered a few
        words of general civility and ran downstairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        That day the minister&rsquo;s clerks and the subordinates had a great deal
        to put up with from his ill-humor. But that same night, he found himself
        the possessor of a fine house, situated on the Boulevard de la Madeleine,
        and an income of 50,000 livres.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day, just as Debray was signing the deed, that is about five o&rsquo;clock
        in the afternoon, Madame de Morcerf, after having affectionately embraced her son,
        entered the <i>coup√©</i> of the diligence, which closed upon her.
      </p>
      <p>
        A man was hidden in Lafitte&rsquo;s banking-house, behind one of the little arched
        windows which are placed above each desk; he saw Merc√©d√®s enter the diligence,
        and he also saw Albert withdraw. Then he passed his hand across his forehead,
        which was clouded with doubt.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;how can I restore the happiness I have
        taken away from these poor innocent creatures? God help me!&rdquo;
