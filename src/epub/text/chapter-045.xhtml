      <h2>Chapter 45. The Rain of Blood</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s the jeweller
        returned to the apartment, he cast around him a scrutinizing glance&mdash;but
        there was nothing to excite suspicion, if it did not exist, or to confirm
        it, if it were already awakened. Caderousse&rsquo;s hands still grasped
        the gold and bank-notes, and La Carconte called up her sweetest smiles
        while welcoming the reappearance of their guest.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said the jeweller, &lsquo;you seem, my good
        friends, to have had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money, by counting
        it over so carefully directly I was gone.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, no,&rsquo; answered Caderousse, &lsquo;that was not my reason, I
        can assure you; but the circumstances by which we have become possessed of this
        wealth are so unexpected, as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune, and it
        is only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that we can
        persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The jeweller smiled. &lsquo;Have you any other guests in your house?&rsquo;
        inquired he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Nobody but ourselves,&rsquo; replied Caderousse; &lsquo;the fact is,
        we do not lodge travellers&mdash;indeed, our tavern is so near the town, that
        nobody would think of stopping here.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Then I am afraid I shall very much inconvenience you.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Inconvenience us? Not at all, my dear sir,&rsquo; said La Carconte
        in her most gracious manner. &lsquo;Not at all, I assure you.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;But where will you manage to stow me?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;In the chamber overhead.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Surely that is where you yourselves sleep?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Never mind that; we have a second bed in the adjoining room.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Caderousse stared at his wife with much astonishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The jeweller, meanwhile, was humming a song as he stood warming his
        back at the fire La Carconte had kindled to dry the wet garments of her
        guest; and this done, she next occupied herself in arranging his supper,
        by spreading a napkin at the end of the table, and placing on it the
        slender remains of their dinner, to which she added three or four
        fresh-laid eggs. Caderousse had once more parted with his treasure&mdash;the
        banknotes were replaced in the pocket-book, the gold put back into the
        bag, and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard. He then began pacing
        the room with a pensive and gloomy air, glancing from time to time at the
        jeweller, who stood reeking with the steam from his wet clothes, and
        merely changing his place on the warm hearth, to enable the whole of his
        garments to be dried.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;There,&rsquo; said La Carconte, as she placed a bottle of
        wine on the table, &lsquo;supper is ready whenever you are.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;And you?&rsquo; asked Joannes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want any supper,&rsquo; said Caderousse.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;We dined so very late,&rsquo; hastily interposed La Carconte.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Then it seems I am to eat alone,&rsquo; remarked the jeweller.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, we shall have the pleasure of waiting upon you,&rsquo; answered
        La Carconte, with an eager attention she was not accustomed to manifest even to
        guests who paid for what they took.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;From time to time Caderousse darted on his wife keen, searching
        glances, but rapid as the lightning flash. The storm still continued.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;There, there,&rsquo; said La Carconte; &lsquo;do you hear that?
        upon my word, you did well to come back.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Nevertheless,&rsquo; replied the jeweller, &lsquo;if by the time I
        have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated, I shall make another
        start.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s the mistral,&rsquo; said Caderousse, &lsquo;and it will be
        sure to last till tomorrow morning.&rsquo; He sighed heavily.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the jeweller, as he placed himself at table,
        &lsquo;all I can say is, so much the worse for those who are abroad.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; chimed in La Carconte, &lsquo;they will have a wretched
        night of it.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The jeweller began eating his supper, and the woman, who was
        ordinarily so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her, was
        suddenly transformed into the most smiling and attentive hostess. Had the
        unhappy man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously
        acquainted with her, so sudden an alteration might well have excited
        suspicion in his mind, or at least have greatly astonished him.
        Caderousse, meanwhile, continued to pace the room in gloomy silence,
        sedulously avoiding the sight of his guest; but as soon as the stranger
        had completed his repast, the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the door
        and opened it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;I believe the storm is over,&rsquo; said he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But as if to contradict his statement, at that instant a violent clap of
        thunder seemed to shake the house to its very foundation, while a sudden gust of
        wind, mingled with rain, extinguished the lamp he held in his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Trembling and awe-struck, Caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to
        his guest, while La Carconte lighted a candle by the smouldering ashes
        that glimmered on the hearth.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;You must be tired,&rsquo; said she to the jeweller; &lsquo;I have
        spread a pair of white sheets on your bed; go up when you are ready, and sleep
        well.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Joannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate
        in its fury, but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that,
        instead of diminishing, the violence of the rain and thunder momentarily
        increased; resigning himself, therefore, to what seemed inevitable, he
        bade his host good-night, and mounted the stairs. He passed over my head
        and I heard the flooring creak beneath his footsteps. The quick, eager
        glance of La Carconte followed him as he ascended, while Caderousse, on
        the contrary, turned his back, and seemed most anxiously to avoid even
        glancing at him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;All these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time
        as they have since done; in fact, all that had happened (with the
        exception of the story of the diamond, which certainly did wear an air of
        improbability), appeared natural enough, and called for neither
        apprehension nor mistrust; but, worn out as I was with fatigue, and fully
        purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated, I determined to
        obtain a few hours&rsquo; sleep. Overhead I could accurately distinguish
        every movement of the jeweller, who, after making the best arrangements in
        his power for passing a comfortable night, threw himself on his bed, and I
        could hear it creak and groan beneath his weight.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Insensibly my eyelids grew heavy, deep sleep stole over me, and having no
        suspicion of anything wrong, I sought not to shake it off. I looked into the
        kitchen once more and saw Caderousse sitting by the side of a long table upon one
        of the low wooden stools which in country places are frequently used instead of
        chairs; his back was turned towards me, so that I could not see the
        expression of his countenance&mdash;neither should I have been able to do
        so had he been placed differently, as his head was buried between his two
        hands. La Carconte continued to gaze on him for some time, then shrugging
        her shoulders, she took her seat immediately opposite to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At this moment the expiring embers threw up a fresh flame from the kindling
        of a piece of wood that lay near, and a bright light flashed over the room. La
        Carconte still kept her eyes fixed on her husband, but as he made no sign
        of changing his position, she extended her hard, bony hand, and touched
        him on the forehead.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20317m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Caderousse shuddered. The woman&rsquo;s lips seemed to move, as
        though she were talking; but because she merely spoke in an undertone, or
        my senses were dulled by sleep, I did not catch a word she uttered.
        Confused sights and sounds seemed to float before me, and gradually I fell
        into a deep, heavy slumber. How long I had been in this unconscious state
        I know not, when I was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol,
        followed by a fearful cry. Weak and tottering footsteps resounded across
        the chamber above me, and the next instant a dull, heavy weight seemed to
        fall powerless on the staircase. I had not yet fully recovered
        consciousness, when again I heard groans, mingled with half-stifled cries,
        as if from persons engaged in a deadly struggle. A cry more prolonged than
        the others and ending in a series of groans effectually roused me from my
        drowsy lethargy. Hastily raising myself on one arm, I looked around, but
        all was dark; and it seemed to me as if the rain must have penetrated
        through the flooring of the room above, for some kind of moisture appeared
        to fall, drop by drop, upon my forehead, and when I passed my hand across
        my brow, I felt that it was wet and clammy.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most
        perfect silence&mdash;unbroken, save by the footsteps of a man walking
        about in the chamber above. The staircase creaked, he descended into the
        room below, approached the fire and lit a candle.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The man was Caderousse&mdash;he was pale and his shirt was all bloody.
        Having obtained the light, he hurried upstairs again, and once more I heard his
        rapid and uneasy footsteps.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A moment later he came down again, holding in his hand the small shagreen
        case, which he opened, to assure himself it contained the diamond,&mdash;seemed
        to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in, then, as if dissatisfied with
        the security of either pocket, he deposited it in his red handkerchief, which he
        carefully rolled round his head.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;After this he took from his cupboard the bank-notes and gold he had put
        there, thrust the one into the pocket of his trousers, and the other into that of
        his waistcoat, hastily tied up a small bundle of linen, and rushing towards the
        door, disappeared in the darkness of the night.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then all became clear and manifest to me, and I reproached myself
        with what had happened, as though I myself had done the guilty deed. I
        fancied that I still heard faint moans, and imagining that the unfortunate
        jeweller might not be quite dead, I determined to go to his relief, by way
        of atoning in some slight degree, not for the crime I had committed, but
        for that which I had not endeavored to prevent. For this purpose I applied
        all the strength I possessed to force an entrance from the cramped spot in
        which I lay to the adjoining room. The poorly fastened boards which alone
        divided me from it yielded to my efforts, and I found myself in the house.
        Hastily snatching up the lighted candle, I hurried to the staircase; about
        midway a body was lying quite across the stairs. It was that of La
        Carconte. The pistol I had heard had doubtless been fired at her. The shot
        had frightfully lacerated her throat, leaving two gaping wounds from
        which, as well as the mouth, the blood was pouring in floods. She was
        stone dead. I strode past her, and ascended to the sleeping chamber, which
        presented an appearance of the wildest disorder. The furniture had been
        knocked over in the deadly struggle that had taken place there, and the
        sheets, to which the unfortunate jeweller had doubtless clung, were
        dragged across the room. The murdered man lay on the floor, his head
        leaning against the wall, and about him was a pool of blood which poured
        forth from three large wounds in his breast; there was a fourth gash, in
        which a long table knife was plunged up to the handle.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I stumbled over some object; I stooped to examine&mdash;it was the
        second pistol, which had not gone off, probably from the powder being wet.
        I approached the jeweller, who was not quite dead, and at the sound of my
        footsteps and the creaking of the floor, he opened his eyes, fixed them on
        me with an anxious and inquiring gaze, moved his lips as though trying to
        speak, then, overcome by the effort, fell back and expired.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This appalling sight almost bereft me of my senses, and finding that I
        could no longer be of service to anyone in the house, my only desire was to fly.
        I rushed towards the staircase, clutching my hair, and uttering a groan of horror.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Upon reaching the room below, I found five or six custom-house officers,
        and two or three gendarmes&mdash;all heavily armed. They threw themselves
        upon me. I made no resistance; I was no longer master of my senses. When I
        strove to speak, a few inarticulate sounds alone escaped my lips.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As I noticed the significant manner in which the whole party
        pointed to my blood-stained garments, I involuntarily surveyed myself, and
        then I discovered that the thick warm drops that had so bedewed me as I
        lay beneath the staircase must have been the blood of La Carconte. I
        pointed to the spot where I had concealed myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;What does he mean?&rsquo; asked a gendarme.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;One of the officers went to the place I directed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;He means,&rsquo; replied the man upon his return, &lsquo;that
        he got in that way;&rsquo; and he showed the hole I had made when I broke
        through.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then I saw that they took me for the assassin. I recovered force
        and energy enough to free myself from the hands of those who held me,
        while I managed to stammer forth:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;I did not do it! Indeed, indeed I did not!&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A couple of gendarmes held the muzzles of their carbines against my breast.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Stir but a step,&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;and you are a dead man.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Why should you threaten me with death,&rsquo; cried I, &lsquo;when
        I have already declared my innocence?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Tush, tush,&rsquo; cried the men; &lsquo;keep your innocent stories
        to tell to the judge at Nîmes. Meanwhile, come along with us; and the best advice
        we can give you is to do so unresistingly.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas, resistance was far from my thoughts. I was utterly overpowered by
        surprise and terror; and without a word I suffered myself to be handcuffed and
        tied to a horse&rsquo;s tail, and thus they took me to Nîmes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I had been tracked by a customs-officer, who had lost sight of me
        near the tavern; feeling certain that I intended to pass the night there,
        he had returned to summon his comrades, who just arrived in time to hear
        the report of the pistol, and to take me in the midst of such
        circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my
        innocence utterly futile. One only chance was left me, that of beseeching
        the magistrate before whom I was taken to cause every inquiry to be made
        for the Abbé Busoni, who had stopped at the inn of the Pont du Gard on
        that morning.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If Caderousse had invented the story relative to the diamond, and there
        existed no such person as the Abbé Busoni, then, indeed, I was lost past
        redemption, or, at least, my life hung upon the feeble chance of Caderousse himself
        being apprehended and confessing the whole truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Two months passed away in hopeless expectation on my part, while I must do
        the magistrate the justice to say that he used every means to obtain information
        of the person I declared could exculpate me if he would. Caderousse still evaded
        all pursuit, and I had resigned myself to what seemed my inevitable fate. My trial
        was to come on at the approaching assizes; when, on the 8th of September&mdash;that
        is to say, precisely three months and five days after the events which had perilled
        my life&mdash;the Abbé Busoni, whom I never ventured to believe I should see,
        presented himself at the prison doors, saying he understood one of the prisoners
        wished to speak to him; he added, that having learned at Marseilles the
        particulars of my imprisonment, he hastened to comply with my desire.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You may easily imagine with what eagerness I welcomed him, and how minutely
        I related the whole of what I had seen and heard. I felt some degree of
        nervousness as I entered upon the history of the diamond, but, to my
        inexpressible astonishment, he confirmed it in every particular, and to my
        equal surprise, he seemed to place entire belief in all I said.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And then it was that, won by his mild charity, seeing that he was acquainted
        with all the habits and customs of my own country, and considering also that
        pardon for the only crime of which I was really guilty might come with a
        double power from lips so benevolent and kind, I besought him to receive
        my confession, under the seal of which I recounted the Auteuil affair in
        all its details, as well as every other transaction of my life. That which
        I had done by the impulse of my best feelings produced the same effect as
        though it had been the result of calculation. My voluntary confession of
        the assassination at Auteuil proved to him that I had not committed that
        of which I stood accused. When he quitted me, he bade me be of good
        courage, and to rely upon his doing all in his power to convince my judges
        of my innocence.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I had speedy proofs that the excellent abbé was engaged in my
        behalf, for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling
        though acceptable indulgences, and I was told that my trial was to be
        postponed to the assizes following those now being held.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In the interim it pleased Providence to cause the apprehension of
        Caderousse, who was discovered in some distant country, and brought back to France,
        where he made a full confession, refusing to make the fact of his wife&rsquo;s
        having suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt. The
        wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life, and I was immediately
        set at liberty.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And then it was, I presume,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo &ldquo;that
        you came to me as the bearer of a letter from the Abbé Busoni?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It was, your excellency; the benevolent abbé took an evident
        interest in all that concerned me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Your mode of life as a smuggler,&rsquo; said he to me one
        day, &lsquo;will be the ruin of you; if you get out, don&rsquo;t take it
        up again.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;But how,&rsquo; inquired I, &lsquo;am I to maintain myself and my
        poor sister?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;A person, whose confessor I am,&rsquo; replied he, &lsquo;and
        who entertains a high regard for me, applied to me a short time since to
        procure him a confidential servant. Would you like such a post? If so, I
        will give you a letter of introduction to him.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, father,&rsquo; I exclaimed, &lsquo;you are very good.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;But you must swear solemnly that I shall never have reason
        to repent my recommendation.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I extended my hand, and was about to pledge myself by any promise he would
        dictate, but he stopped me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;It is unnecessary for you to bind yourself by any vow,&rsquo; said
        he; &lsquo;I know and admire the Corsican nature too well to fear you. Here,
        take this,&rsquo; continued he, after rapidly writing the few lines I
        brought to your excellency, and upon receipt of which you deigned to
        receive me into your service, and proudly I ask whether your excellency
        has ever had cause to repent having done so?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the count; &ldquo;I take pleasure in saying that
        you have served me faithfully, Bertuccio; but you might have shown more
        confidence in me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I, your excellency?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; you. How comes it, that having both a sister and an adopted
        son, you have never spoken to me of either?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20323m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas, I have still to recount the most distressing period of my
        life. Anxious as you may suppose I was to behold and comfort my dear
        sister, I lost no time in hastening to Corsica, but when I arrived at
        Rogliano I found a house of mourning, the consequences of a scene so
        horrible that the neighbors remember and speak of it to this day. Acting
        by my advice, my poor sister had refused to comply with the unreasonable
        demands of Benedetto, who was continually tormenting her for money, as
        long as he believed there was a sou left in her possession. One morning he
        threatened her with the severest consequences if she did not supply him
        with what he desired, and disappeared and remained away all day, leaving
        the kind-hearted Assunta, who loved him as if he were her own child, to
        weep over his conduct and bewail his absence. Evening came, and still,
        with all the patient solicitude of a mother, she watched for his return.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As the eleventh hour struck, he entered with a swaggering air,
        attended by two of the most dissolute and reckless of his boon companions.
        She stretched out her arms to him, but they seized hold of her, and one of
        the three&mdash;none other than the accursed Benedetto exclaimed:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Put her to torture and she&rsquo;ll soon tell us where her money
        is.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It unfortunately happened that our neighbor, Wasilio, was at
        Bastia, leaving no person in his house but his wife; no human creature
        beside could hear or see anything that took place within our dwelling. Two
        held poor Assunta, who, unable to conceive that any harm was intended to
        her, smiled in the face of those who were soon to become her executioners.
        The third proceeded to barricade the doors and windows, then returned, and
        the three united in stifling the cries of terror incited by the sight of
        these preparations, and then dragged Assunta feet foremost towards the
        brazier, expecting to wring from her an avowal of where her supposed
        treasure was secreted. In the struggle her clothes caught fire, and they
        were obliged to let go their hold in order to preserve themselves from
        sharing the same fate. Covered with flames, Assunta rushed wildly to the
        door, but it was fastened; she flew to the windows, but they were also
        secured; then the neighbors heard frightful shrieks; it was Assunta
        calling for help. The cries died away in groans, and next morning, as soon
        as Wasilio&rsquo;s wife could muster up courage to venture abroad, she
        caused the door of our dwelling to be opened by the public authorities,
        when Assunta, although dreadfully burnt, was found still breathing; every
        drawer and closet in the house had been forced open, and the money stolen.
        Benedetto never again appeared at Rogliano, neither have I since that day
        either seen or heard anything concerning him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It was subsequently to these dreadful events that I waited on your
        excellency, to whom it would have been folly to have mentioned Benedetto,
        since all trace of him seemed entirely lost; or of my sister, since she
        was dead.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And in what light did you view the occurrence?&rdquo; inquired
        Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As a punishment for the crime I had committed,&rdquo; answered
        Bertuccio. &ldquo;Oh, those Villeforts are an accursed race!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Truly they are,&rdquo; murmured the count in a lugubrious tone.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; resumed Bertuccio, &ldquo;your excellency may,
        perhaps, be able to comprehend that this place, which I revisit for the
        first time&mdash;this garden, the actual scene of my crime&mdash;must have
        given rise to reflections of no very agreeable nature, and produced that
        gloom and depression of spirits which excited the notice of your
        excellency, who was pleased to express a desire to know the cause. At this
        instant a shudder passes over me as I reflect that possibly I am now
        standing on the very grave in which lies M. de Villefort, by whose hand
        the ground was dug to receive the corpse of his child.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Everything is possible,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, rising from the
        bench on which he had been sitting; &ldquo;even,&rdquo; he added in an
        inaudible voice, &ldquo;even that the procureur be not dead. The Abbé
        Busoni did right to send you to me,&rdquo; he went on in his ordinary
        tone, &ldquo;and you have done well in relating to me the whole of your
        history, as it will prevent my forming any erroneous opinions concerning
        you in future. As for that Benedetto, who so grossly belied his name, have
        you never made any effort to trace out whither he has gone, or what has
        become of him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; far from wishing to learn whither he has betaken himself, I
        should shun the possibility of meeting him as I would a wild beast. Thank
        God, I have never heard his name mentioned by any person, and I hope and
        believe he is dead.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do not think so, Bertuccio,&rdquo; replied the count; &ldquo;for
        the wicked are not so easily disposed of, for God seems to have them under
        his special watch-care to make of them instruments of his vengeance.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; responded Bertuccio, &ldquo;all I ask of heaven is
        that I may never see him again. And now, your excellency,&rdquo; he added,
        bowing his head, &ldquo;you know everything&mdash;you are my judge on
        earth, as the Almighty is in heaven; have you for me no words of
        consolation?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My good friend, I can only repeat the words addressed to you by the
        Abbé Busoni. Villefort merited punishment for what he had done to you,
        and, perhaps, to others. Benedetto, if still living, will become the
        instrument of divine retribution in some way or other, and then be duly
        punished in his turn. As far as you yourself are concerned, I see but one
        point in which you are really guilty. Ask yourself, wherefore, after
        rescuing the infant from its living grave, you did not restore it to its
        mother? There was the crime, Bertuccio&mdash;that was where you became
        really culpable.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;True, excellency, that was the crime, the real crime, for in that I
        acted like a coward. My first duty, directly I had succeeded in recalling
        the babe to life, was to restore it to its mother; but, in order to do so,
        I must have made close and careful inquiry, which would, in all
        probability, have led to my own apprehension; and I clung to life, partly
        on my sister&rsquo;s account, and partly from that feeling of pride inborn
        in our hearts of desiring to come off untouched and victorious in the
        execution of our vengeance. Perhaps, too, the natural and instinctive love
        of life made me wish to avoid endangering my own. And then, again, I am
        not as brave and courageous as was my poor brother.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Bertuccio hid his face in his hands as he uttered these words, while Monte Cristo
        fixed on him a look of inscrutable meaning. After a brief silence, rendered
        still more solemn by the time and place, the count said, in a tone of
        melancholy wholly unlike his usual manner:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In order to bring this conversation to a fitting termination (the last we
        shall ever hold upon this subject), I will repeat to you some words I have heard
        from the lips of the Abbé Busoni. For all evils there are two remedies&mdash;time
        and silence. And now leave me, Monsieur Bertuccio, to walk alone here in the
        garden. The very circumstances which inflict on you, as a principal in the
        tragic scene enacted here, such painful emotions, are to me, on the
        contrary, a source of something like contentment, and serve but to enhance
        the value of this dwelling in my estimation. The chief beauty of trees
        consists in the deep shadow of their umbrageous boughs, while fancy
        pictures a moving multitude of shapes and forms flitting and passing
        beneath that shade. Here I have a garden laid out in such a way as to
        afford the fullest scope for the imagination, and furnished with thickly
        grown trees, beneath whose leafy screen a visionary like myself may
        conjure up phantoms at will. This to me, who expected but to find a blank
        enclosure surrounded by a straight wall, is, I assure you, a most
        agreeable surprise. I have no fear of ghosts, and I have never heard it
        said that so much harm had been done by the dead during six thousand years
        as is wrought by the living in a single day. Retire within, Bertuccio, and
        tranquillize your mind. Should your confessor be less indulgent to you in
        your dying moments than you found the Abbé Busoni, send for me, if I am
        still on earth, and I will soothe your ears with words that shall
        effectually calm and soothe your parting soul ere it goes forth to
        traverse the ocean called eternity.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Bertuccio bowed respectfully, and turned away, sighing heavily. Monte
        Cristo, left alone, took three or four steps onwards, and murmured:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Here, beneath this plane-tree, must have been where the infant&rsquo;s
        grave was dug. There is the little door opening into the garden. At this
        corner is the private staircase communicating with the sleeping apartment.
        There will be no necessity for me to make a note of these particulars, for
        there, before my eyes, beneath my feet, all around me, I have the plan
        sketched with all the living reality of truth.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        After making the tour of the garden a second time, the count re-entered his
        carriage, while Bertuccio, who perceived the thoughtful expression of his
        master&rsquo;s features, took his seat beside the driver without uttering a word.
        The carriage proceeded rapidly towards Paris.
      </p>
      <p>
        That same evening, upon reaching his abode in the Champs-Élysées, the
        Count of Monte Cristo went over the whole building with the air of one
        long acquainted with each nook or corner. Nor, although preceding the
        party, did he once mistake one door for another, or commit the smallest
        error when choosing any particular corridor or staircase to conduct him to
        a place or suite of rooms he desired to visit. Ali was his principal
        attendant during this nocturnal survey. Having given various orders to
        Bertuccio relative to the improvements and alterations he desired to make
        in the house, the Count, drawing out his watch, said to the attentive Nubian:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is half-past eleven o&rsquo;clock; Haydée will soon be
        here. Have the French attendants been summoned to await her coming?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Ali extended his hands towards the apartments destined for the fair Greek,
        which were so effectually concealed by means of a tapestried entrance,
        that it would have puzzled the most curious to have divined their
        existence. Ali, having pointed to the apartments, held up three fingers of
        his right hand, and then, placing it beneath his head, shut his eyes, and
        feigned to sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, well acquainted with Ali&rsquo;s
        pantomime; &ldquo;you mean to tell me that three female attendants await their new
        mistress in her sleeping-chamber.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Ali, with considerable animation, made a sign in the affirmative.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Madame will be tired tonight,&rdquo; continued Monte Cristo,
        &ldquo;and will, no doubt, wish to rest. Desire the French attendants not
        to weary her with questions, but merely to pay their respectful duty and
        retire. You will also see that the Greek servants hold no communication
        with those of this country.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He bowed. Just at that moment voices were heard hailing the concierge. The gate
        opened, a carriage rolled down the avenue, and stopped at the steps. The count
        hastily descended, presented himself at the already opened carriage door, and held
        out his hand to a young woman, completely enveloped in a green silk mantle heavily
        embroidered with gold. She raised the hand extended towards her to her
        lips, and kissed it with a mixture of love and respect. Some few words
        passed between them in that sonorous language in which Homer makes his
        gods converse. The young woman spoke with an expression of deep
        tenderness, while the count replied with an air of gentle gravity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Preceded by Ali, who carried a rose-colored flambeau in his hand, the
        young lady, who was no other than the lovely Greek who had been Monte
        Cristo&rsquo;s companion in Italy, was conducted to her apartments, while
        the count retired to the pavilion reserved for himself. In another hour
        every light in the house was extinguished, and it might have been thought
        that all its inmates slept.
