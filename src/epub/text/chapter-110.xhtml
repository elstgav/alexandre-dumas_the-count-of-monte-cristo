      <h2>Chapter 110. The Indictment</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he judges took
        their places in the midst of the most profound silence; the jury took
        their seats; M. de Villefort, the object of unusual attention, and we had
        almost said of general admiration, sat in the armchair and cast a tranquil
        glance around him. Everyone looked with astonishment on that grave and
        severe face, whose calm expression personal griefs had been unable to
        disturb, and the aspect of a man who was a stranger to all human emotions
        excited something very like terror.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Gendarmes,&rdquo; said the president, &ldquo;lead in the accused.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At these words the public attention became more intense, and all eyes were
        turned towards the door through which Benedetto was to enter. The door
        soon opened and the accused appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same impression was experienced by all present, and no one was deceived by
        the expression of his countenance. His features bore no sign of that deep emotion
        which stops the beating of the heart and blanches the cheek. His hands, gracefully
        placed, one upon his hat, the other in the opening of his white waistcoat,
        were not at all tremulous; his eye was calm and even brilliant. Scarcely
        had he entered the hall when he glanced at the whole body of magistrates
        and assistants; his eye rested longer on the president, and still more so
        on the king&rsquo;s attorney.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the side of Andrea was stationed the lawyer who was to conduct his
        defence, and who had been appointed by the court, for Andrea disdained to
        pay any attention to those details, to which he appeared to attach no
        importance. The lawyer was a young man with light hair whose face
        expressed a hundred times more emotion than that which characterized the
        prisoner.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50181m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        The president called for the indictment, revised as we know, by the clever
        and implacable pen of Villefort. During the reading of this, which was
        long, the public attention was continually drawn towards Andrea, who bore
        the inspection with Spartan unconcern. Villefort had never been so concise
        and eloquent. The crime was depicted in the most vivid colors; the former
        life of the prisoner, his transformation, a review of his life from the
        earliest period, were set forth with all the talent that a knowledge of
        human life could furnish to a mind like that of the procureur. Benedetto
        was thus forever condemned in public opinion before the sentence of the
        law could be pronounced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Andrea paid no attention to the successive charges which were brought
        against him. M. de Villefort, who examined him attentively, and who no
        doubt practiced upon him all the psychological studies he was accustomed
        to use, in vain endeavored to make him lower his eyes, notwithstanding the
        depth and profundity of his gaze. At length the reading of the indictment
        was ended.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Accused,&rdquo; said the president, &ldquo;your name and surname?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Andrea arose.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. President,&rdquo; he said, in a clear voice, &ldquo;but
        I see you are going to adopt a course of questions through which I cannot
        follow you. I have an idea, which I will explain by and by, of making an
        exception to the usual form of accusation. Allow me, then, if you please,
        to answer in different order, or I will not do so at all.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The astonished president looked at the jury, who in turn looked at Villefort.
        The whole assembly manifested great surprise, but Andrea appeared quite unmoved.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your age?&rdquo; said the president; &ldquo;will you answer that
        question?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will answer that question, as well as the rest, Mr. President,
        but in its turn.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your age?&rdquo; repeated the president.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am twenty-one years old, or rather I shall be in a few days, as I
        was born the night of the 27th of September, 1817.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        M. de Villefort, who was busy taking down some notes, raised his head at the
        mention of this date.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where were you born?&rdquo; continued the president.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At Auteuil, near Paris.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        M. de Villefort a second time raised his head, looked at Benedetto as if he
        had been gazing at the head of Medusa, and became livid. As for Benedetto,
        he gracefully wiped his lips with a fine cambric pocket-handkerchief.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your profession?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;First I was a forger,&rdquo; answered Andrea, as calmly as possible;
        &ldquo;then I became a thief, and lately have become an assassin.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        A murmur, or rather storm, of indignation burst from all parts of the assembly.
        The judges themselves appeared to be stupefied, and the jury manifested tokens
        of disgust for a cynicism so unexpected in a man of fashion. M. de Villefort
        pressed his hand upon his brow, which, at first pale, had become red and burning;
        then he suddenly arose and looked around as though he had lost his
        senses&mdash;he wanted air.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50183m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you looking for anything, Mr. Procureur?&rdquo; asked
        Benedetto, with his most ingratiating smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        M. de Villefort answered nothing, but sat, or rather threw himself down again
        upon his chair.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And now, prisoner, will you consent to tell your name?&rdquo; said
        the president. &ldquo;The brutal affectation with which you have
        enumerated and classified your crimes calls for a severe reprimand on the
        part of the court, both in the name of morality, and for the respect due
        to humanity. You appear to consider this a point of honor, and it may be
        for this reason, that you have delayed acknowledging your name. You wished
        it to be preceded by all these titles.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is quite wonderful, Mr. President, how entirely you have read my
        thoughts,&rdquo; said Benedetto, in his softest voice and most polite
        manner. &ldquo;This is, indeed, the reason why I begged you to alter the
        order of the questions.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The public astonishment had reached its height. There was no longer any deceit
        or bravado in the manner of the accused. The audience felt that a startling
        revelation was to follow this ominous prelude.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the president; &ldquo;your name?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I cannot tell you my name, since I do not know it; but I know my
        father&rsquo;s, and can tell it to you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        A painful giddiness overwhelmed Villefort; great drops of acrid sweat fell
        from his face upon the papers which he held in his convulsed hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Repeat your father&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; said the president.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not a whisper, not a breath, was heard in that vast assembly; everyone waited
        anxiously.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My father is king&rsquo;s attorney,&rdquo; replied Andrea calmly.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50179m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;King&rsquo;s attorney?&rdquo; said the president, stupefied, and
        without noticing the agitation which spread over the face of M. de
        Villefort; &ldquo;king&rsquo;s attorney?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; and if you wish to know his name, I will tell it,&mdash;he is
        named Villefort.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The explosion, which had been so long restrained from a feeling of respect to
        the court of justice, now burst forth like thunder from the breasts of all
        present; the court itself did not seek to restrain the feelings of the audience.
        The exclamations, the insults addressed to Benedetto, who remained perfectly
        unconcerned, the energetic gestures, the movement of the gendarmes, the sneers
        of the scum of the crowd always sure to rise to the surface in case of any
        disturbance&mdash;all this lasted five minutes, before the door-keepers and
        magistrates were able to restore silence. In the midst of this tumult the voice
        of thepresident was heard to exclaim:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you playing with justice, accused, and do you dare set your
        fellow-citizens an example of disorder which even in these times has never
        been equalled?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Several persons hurried up to M. de Villefort, who sat half bowed over in
        his chair, offering him consolation, encouragement, and protestations of
        zeal and sympathy. Order was re-established in the hall, except that a few
        people still moved about and whispered to one another. A lady, it was
        said, had just fainted; they had supplied her with a smelling-bottle, and
        she had recovered. During the scene of tumult, Andrea had turned his
        smiling face towards the assembly; then, leaning with one hand on the
        oaken rail of the dock, in the most graceful attitude possible, he said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Gentlemen, I assure you I had no idea of insulting the court, or of
        making a useless disturbance in the presence of this honorable assembly.
        They ask my age; I tell it. They ask where I was born; I answer. They ask
        my name, I cannot give it, since my parents abandoned me. But though I
        cannot give my own name, not possessing one, I can tell them my father&rsquo;s.
        Now I repeat, my father is named M. de Villefort, and I am ready to prove
        it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        There was an energy, a conviction, and a sincerity in the manner of the
        young man, which silenced the tumult. All eyes were turned for a moment
        towards the procureur, who sat as motionless as though a thunderbolt had
        changed him into a corpse.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Andrea, commanding silence by his voice and
        manner; &ldquo;I owe you the proofs and explanations of what I have said.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the irritated president, &ldquo;you called
        yourself Benedetto, declared yourself an orphan, and claimed Corsica as
        your country.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I said anything I pleased, in order that the solemn declaration I
        have just made should not be withheld, which otherwise would certainly
        have been the case. I now repeat that I was born at Auteuil on the night
        of the 27th of September, 1817, and that I am the son of the procureur, M.
        de Villefort. Do you wish for any further details? I will give them. I was
        born in No. 28, Rue de la Fontaine, in a room hung with red damask; my
        father took me in his arms, telling my mother I was dead, wrapped me in a
        napkin marked with an H and an N, and carried me into a garden, where he
        buried me alive.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        A shudder ran through the assembly when they saw that the confidence of
        the prisoner increased in proportion to the terror of M. de Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But how have you become acquainted with all these details?&rdquo;
        asked the president.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will tell you, Mr. President. A man who had sworn vengeance
        against my father, and had long watched his opportunity to kill him, had
        introduced himself that night into the garden in which my father buried
        me. He was concealed in a thicket; he saw my father bury something in the
        ground, and stabbed him; then thinking the deposit might contain some
        treasure he turned up the ground, and found me still living. The man
        carried me to the foundling asylum, where I was registered under the
        number 37. Three months afterwards, a woman travelled from Rogliano to
        Paris to fetch me, and having claimed me as her son, carried me away.
        Thus, you see, though born in Paris, I was brought up in Corsica.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a moment&rsquo;s silence, during which one could have fancied
        the hall empty, so profound was the stillness.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Proceed,&rdquo; said the president.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly, I might have lived happily amongst those good people,
        who adored me, but my perverse disposition prevailed over the virtues
        which my adopted mother endeavored to instil into my heart. I increased in
        wickedness till I committed crime. One day when I cursed Providence for
        making me so wicked, and ordaining me to such a fate, my adopted father
        said to me, &lsquo;Do not blaspheme, unhappy child, the crime is that of
        your father, not yours,&mdash;of your father, who consigned you to hell if
        you died, and to misery if a miracle preserved you alive.&rsquo; After
        that I ceased to blaspheme, but I cursed my father. That is why I have
        uttered the words for which you blame me; that is why I have filled this
        whole assembly with horror. If I have committed an additional crime,
        punish me, but if you will allow that ever since the day of my birth my
        fate has been sad, bitter, and lamentable, then pity me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But your mother?&rdquo; asked the president.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My mother thought me dead; she is not guilty. I did not even wish
        to know her name, nor do I know it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Just then a piercing cry, ending in a sob, burst from the centre of the crowd,
        who encircled the lady who had before fainted, and who now fell into a violent
        fit of hysterics. She was carried out of the hall, the thick veil which concealed
        her face dropped off, and Madame Danglars was recognized. Notwithstanding
        his shattered nerves, the ringing sensation in his ears, and the madness
        which turned his brain, Villefort rose as he perceived her.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The proofs, the proofs!&rdquo; said the president; &ldquo;remember
        this tissue of horrors must be supported by the clearest proofs.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The proofs?&rdquo; said Benedetto, laughing; &ldquo;do you want
        proofs?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, look at M. de Villefort, and then ask me for proofs.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone turned towards the procureur, who, unable to bear the universal
        gaze now riveted on him alone, advanced staggering into the midst of the
        tribunal, with his hair dishevelled and his face indented with the mark of
        his nails. The whole assembly uttered a long murmur of astonishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Benedetto, &ldquo;I am asked for proofs, do you
        wish me to give them?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no, it is useless,&rdquo; stammered M. de Villefort in a hoarse
        voice; &ldquo;no, it is useless!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How useless?&rdquo; cried the president, &ldquo;what do you mean?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I mean that I feel it impossible to struggle against this deadly
        weight which crushes me. Gentlemen, I know I am in the hands of an
        avenging God! We need no proofs; everything relating to this young man is
        true.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        A dull, gloomy silence, like that which precedes some awful phenomenon of
        nature, pervaded the assembly, who shuddered in dismay.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What, M. de Villefort,&rdquo; cried the president, &ldquo;do you
        yield to an hallucination? What, are you no longer in possession of your
        senses? This strange, unexpected, terrible accusation has disordered your
        reason. Come, recover.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The procureur dropped his head; his teeth chattered like those of a man
        under a violent attack of fever, and yet he was deadly pale.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am in possession of all my senses, sir,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;my
        body alone suffers, as you may suppose. I acknowledge myself guilty of all
        the young man has brought against me, and from this hour hold myself under
        the authority of the procureur who will succeed me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And as he spoke these words with a hoarse, choking voice, he staggered
        towards the door, which was mechanically opened by a door-keeper. The
        whole assembly were dumb with astonishment at the revelation and
        confession which had produced a catastrophe so different from that which
        had been expected during the last fortnight by the Parisian world.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Beauchamp, &ldquo;let them now say that drama is
        unnatural!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i>&rdquo; said Château-Renaud, &ldquo;I would rather
        end my career like M. de Morcerf; a pistol-shot seems quite delightful
        compared with this catastrophe.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And moreover, it kills,&rdquo; said Beauchamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And to think that I had an idea of marrying his daughter,&rdquo;
        said Debray. &ldquo;She did well to die, poor girl!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The sitting is adjourned, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the president;
        &ldquo;fresh inquiries will be made, and the case will be tried next
        session by another magistrate.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        As for Andrea, who was calm and more interesting than ever, he left the hall,
        escorted by gendarmes, who involuntarily paid him some attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what do you think of this, my fine fellow?&rdquo; asked
        Debray of the sergeant-at-arms, slipping a louis into his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There will be extenuating circumstances,&rdquo; he replied.
