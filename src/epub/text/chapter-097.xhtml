      <h2>Chapter 97. The Departure for Belgium</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> few minutes after
        the scene of confusion produced in the salons of M. Danglars by the
        unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers, and by the disclosure
        which had followed, the mansion was deserted with as much rapidity as if a
        case of plague or of cholera morbus had broken out among the guests.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a few minutes, through all the doors, down all the staircases, by every
        exit, everyone hastened to retire, or rather to fly; for it was a
        situation where the ordinary condolences,&mdash;which even the best
        friends are so eager to offer in great catastrophes,&mdash;were seen to be
        utterly futile. There remained in the banker&rsquo;s house only Danglars,
        closeted in his study, and making his statement to the officer of
        gendarmes; Madame Danglars, terrified, in the boudoir with which we are
        acquainted; and Eugénie, who with haughty air and disdainful lip had
        retired to her room with her inseparable companion, Mademoiselle Louise d&rsquo;Armilly.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the numerous servants (more numerous that evening than usual, for
        their number was augmented by cooks and butlers from the Café de Paris),
        venting on their employers their anger at what they termed the insult to
        which they had been subjected, they collected in groups in the hall, in
        the kitchens, or in their rooms, thinking very little of their duty, which
        was thus naturally interrupted. Of all this household, only two persons
        deserve our notice; these are Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars and
        Mademoiselle Louise d&rsquo;Armilly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The betrothed had retired, as we said, with haughty air, disdainful lip,
        and the demeanor of an outraged queen, followed by her companion, who was
        paler and more disturbed than herself. On reaching her room Eugénie locked
        her door, while Louise fell on a chair.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, what a dreadful thing,&rdquo; said the young musician; &ldquo;who
        would have suspected it? M. Andrea Cavalcanti a murderer&mdash;a
        galley-slave escaped&mdash;a convict!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        An ironical smile curled the lip of Eugénie. &ldquo;In truth, I was fated,&rdquo;
        said she. &ldquo;I escaped the Morcerf only to fall into the Cavalcanti.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, do not confound the two, Eugénie.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Hold your tongue! The men are all infamous, and I am happy to be
        able now to do more than detest them&mdash;I despise them.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; asked Louise.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, the same we had intended doing three days since&mdash;set off.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What?&mdash;although you are not now going to be married, you
        intend still&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen, Louise. I hate this life of the fashionable world, always
        ordered, measured, ruled, like our music-paper. What I have always wished
        for, desired, and coveted, is the life of an artist, free and independent,
        relying only on my own resources, and accountable only to myself. Remain
        here? What for?&mdash;that they may try, a month hence, to marry me again;
        and to whom?&mdash;M. Debray, perhaps, as it was once proposed. No,
        Louise, no! This evening&rsquo;s adventure will serve for my excuse. I did
        not seek one, I did not ask for one. God sends me this, and I hail it
        joyfully!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How strong and courageous you are!&rdquo; said the fair, frail girl
        to her brunette companion.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you not yet know me? Come, Louise, let us talk of our affairs.
        The post-chaise&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Was happily bought three days since.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you had it sent where we are to go for it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Our passport?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And Eugénie, with her usual precision, opened a printed paper, and read:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. Léon d&rsquo;Armilly, twenty years of age; profession, artist;
        hair black, eyes black; travelling with his sister.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Capital! How did you get this passport?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;When I went to ask M. de Monte Cristo for letters to the directors
        of the theatres at Rome and Naples, I expressed my fears of travelling as
        a woman; he perfectly understood them, and undertook to procure for me a
        man&rsquo;s passport, and two days after I received this, to which I have
        added with my own hand, &lsquo;travelling with his sister.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50035m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Eugénie cheerfully, &ldquo;we have then only to
        pack up our trunks; we shall start the evening of the signing of the
        contract, instead of the evening of the wedding&mdash;that is all.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But consider the matter seriously, Eugénie!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I am done with considering! I am tired of hearing only of
        market reports, of the end of the month, of the rise and fall of Spanish
        funds, of Haitian bonds. Instead of that, Louise&mdash;do you understand?&mdash;air,
        liberty, melody of birds, plains of Lombardy, Venetian canals, Roman
        palaces, the Bay of Naples. How much have we, Louise?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The young girl to whom this question was addressed drew from an inlaid secretaire
        a small portfolio with a lock, in which she counted twenty-three bank-notes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Twenty-three thousand francs,&rdquo; said she.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And as much, at least, in pearls, diamonds, and jewels,&rdquo; said
        Eugénie. &ldquo;We are rich. With forty-five thousand francs we can live
        like princesses for two years, and comfortably for four; but before six
        months&mdash;you with your music, and I with my voice&mdash;we shall
        double our capital. Come, you shall take charge of the money, I of the
        jewel-box; so that if one of us had the misfortune to lose her treasure,
        the other would still have hers left. Now, the portmanteau&mdash;let us
        make haste&mdash;the portmanteau!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; said Louise, going to listen at Madame Danglars&rsquo;
        door.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you fear?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That we may be discovered.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The door is locked.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They may tell us to open it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They may if they like, but we will not.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are a perfect Amazon, Eugénie!&rdquo; And the two young girls
        began to heap into a trunk all the things they thought they should require.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There now,&rdquo; said Eugénie, &ldquo;while I change my costume do you
        lock the portmanteau.&rdquo; Louise pressed with all the strength of her little
        hands on the top of the portmanteau.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But I cannot,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;I am not strong enough; do you
        shut it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, you do well to ask,&rdquo; said Eugénie, laughing; &ldquo;I
        forgot that I was Hercules, and you only the pale Omphale!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And the young girl, kneeling on the top, pressed the two parts of the portmanteau
        together, and Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Armilly passed the bolt of the padlock
        through. When this was done, Eugénie opened a drawer, of which she kept
        the key, and took from it a wadded violet silk travelling cloak.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you see I have thought of everything;
        with this cloak you will not be cold.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I am never cold, you know! Besides, with these men&rsquo;s
        clothes&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Will you dress here?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall you have time?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do not be uneasy, you little coward! All our servants are busy,
        discussing the grand affair. Besides, what is there astonishing, when you
        think of the grief I ought to be in, that I shut myself up?&mdash;tell me!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, truly&mdash;you comfort me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come and help me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        From the same drawer she took a man&rsquo;s complete costume, from the
        boots to the coat, and a provision of linen, where there was nothing
        superfluous, but every requisite. Then, with a promptitude which indicated
        that this was not the first time she had amused herself by adopting the
        garb of the opposite sex, Eugénie drew on the boots and pantaloons, tied
        her cravat, buttoned her waistcoat up to the throat, and put on a coat
        which admirably fitted her beautiful figure.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, that is very good&mdash;indeed, it is very good!&rdquo; said Louise,
        looking at her with admiration; &ldquo;but that beautiful black hair, those
        magnificent braids, which made all the ladies sigh with envy,&mdash;will they go
        under a man&rsquo;s hat like the one I see down there?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You shall see,&rdquo; said Eugénie. And with her left hand seizing
        the thick mass, which her long fingers could scarcely grasp, she took in
        her right hand a pair of long scissors, and soon the steel met through the
        rich and splendid hair, which fell in a cluster at her feet as she leaned
        back to keep it from her coat. Then she grasped the front hair, which she
        also cut off, without expressing the least regret; on the contrary, her
        eyes sparkled with greater pleasure than usual under her ebony eyebrows.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50039m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, the magnificent hair!&rdquo; said Louise, with regret.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And am I not a hundred times better thus?&rdquo; cried Eugénie,
        smoothing the scattered curls of her hair, which had now quite a masculine
        appearance; &ldquo;and do you not think me handsomer so?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, you are beautiful&mdash;always beautiful!&rdquo; cried Louise.
        &ldquo;Now, where are you going?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To Brussels, if you like; it is the nearest frontier. We can go to
        Brussels, Liège, Aix-la-Chapelle; then up the Rhine to Strasbourg. We will
        cross Switzerland, and go down into Italy by the Saint-Gothard. Will that
        do?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What are you looking at?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am looking at you; indeed you are adorable like that! One would
        say you were carrying me off.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And they would be right, <i>pardieu!</i>&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I think you swore, Eugénie.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And the two young girls, whom everyone might have thought plunged in grief, the
        one on her own account, the other from interest in her friend, burst out laughing,
        as they cleared away every visible trace of the disorder which had naturally
        accompanied the preparations for their escape. Then, having blown out the
        lights, the two fugitives, looking and listening eagerly, with
        outstretched necks, opened the door of a dressing-room which led by a side
        staircase down to the yard,&mdash;Eugénie going first, and holding with
        one arm the portmanteau, which by the opposite handle Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Armilly
        scarcely raised with both hands. The yard was empty; the clock was
        striking twelve. The porter was not yet gone to bed. Eugénie approached
        softly, and saw the old man sleeping soundly in an armchair in his lodge.
        She returned to Louise, took up the portmanteau, which she had placed for
        a moment on the ground, and they reached the archway under the shadow of
        the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eugénie concealed Louise in an angle of the gateway, so that if the porter
        chanced to awake he might see but one person. Then placing herself in the
        full light of the lamp which lit the yard:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Gate!&rdquo; cried she, with her finest contralto voice, and rapping
        at the window.
      </p>
      <p>
        The porter got up as Eugénie expected, and even advanced some steps to
        recognize the person who was going out, but seeing a young man striking
        his boot impatiently with his riding-whip, he opened it immediately.
        Louise slid through the half-open gate like a snake, and bounded lightly
        forward. Eugénie, apparently calm, although in all probability her heart
        beat somewhat faster than usual, went out in her turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        A porter was passing and they gave him the portmanteau; then the two young girls,
        having told him to take it to No. 36, Rue de la Victoire, walked behind
        this man, whose presence comforted Louise. As for Eugénie, she was as
        strong as a Judith or a Delilah. They arrived at the appointed spot.
        Eugénie ordered the porter to put down the portmanteau, gave him some
        pieces of money, and having rapped at the shutter sent him away. The
        shutter where Eugénie had rapped was that of a little laundress, who had
        been previously warned, and was not yet gone to bed. She opened the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said Eugénie, &ldquo;let the porter get the
        post-chaise from the coach-house, and fetch some post-horses from the
        hotel. Here are five francs for his trouble.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Louise, &ldquo;I admire you, and I could almost
        say respect you.&rdquo; The laundress looked on in astonishment, but as
        she had been promised twenty louis, she made no remark.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a quarter of an hour the porter returned with a post-boy and horses,
        which were harnessed, and put in the post-chaise in a minute, while the
        porter fastened the portmanteau on with the assistance of a cord and strap.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Here is the passport,&rdquo; said the postilion, &ldquo;which way are
        we going, young gentleman?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To Fontainebleau,&rdquo; replied Eugénie with an almost masculine
        voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; said Louise.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am giving them the slip,&rdquo; said Eugénie; &ldquo;this woman
        to whom we have given twenty louis may betray us for forty; we will soon
        alter our direction.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And the young girl jumped into the britzka, which was admirably arranged for
        sleeping in, without scarcely touching the step.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are always right,&rdquo; said the music teacher, seating herself by
        the side of her friend.
      </p>
      <p>
        A quarter of an hour afterwards the postilion, having been put in the
        right road, passed with a crack of his whip through the gateway of the
        Barrière Saint-Martin.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Louise, breathing freely, &ldquo;here we are out of
        Paris.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, my dear, the abduction is an accomplished fact,&rdquo; replied
        Eugénie.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, and without violence,&rdquo; said Louise.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall bring that forward as an extenuating circumstance,&rdquo;
        replied Eugénie.
      </p>
      <p>
        These words were lost in the noise which the carriage made in rolling over the
        pavement of La Villette. M. Danglars no longer had a daughter.
