      <h2>Chapter 104. Danglars&rsquo; Signature</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he next morning
        dawned dull and cloudy. During the night the undertakers had executed
        their melancholy office, and wrapped the corpse in the winding-sheet,
        which, whatever may be said about the equality of death, is at least a
        last proof of the luxury so pleasing in life. This winding-sheet was
        nothing more than a beautiful piece of cambric, which the young girl had
        bought a fortnight before.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the evening two men, engaged for the purpose, had carried Noirtier from
        Valentine&rsquo;s room into his own, and contrary to all expectation there was
        no difficulty in withdrawing him from his child. The Abbé Busoni had watched till
        daylight, and then left without calling anyone. D&rsquo;Avrigny returned about
        eight o&rsquo;clock in the morning; he met Villefort on his way to Noirtier&rsquo;s
        room, and accompanied him to see how the old man had slept. They found him in the
        large armchair, which served him for a bed, enjoying a calm, nay, almost a
        smiling sleep. They both stood in amazement at the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;See,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Avrigny to Villefort, &ldquo;nature knows
        how to alleviate the deepest sorrow. No one can say that M. Noirtier did
        not love his child, and yet he sleeps.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, you are right,&rdquo; replied Villefort, surprised; &ldquo;he
        sleeps, indeed! And this is the more strange, since the least
        contradiction keeps him awake all night.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Grief has stunned him,&rdquo; replied d&rsquo;Avrigny; and they
        both returned thoughtfully to the procureur&rsquo;s study.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;See, I have not slept,&rdquo; said Villefort, showing his
        undisturbed bed; &ldquo;grief does not stun me. I have not been in bed for
        two nights; but then look at my desk; see what I have written during these
        two days and nights. I have filled those papers, and have made out the
        accusation against the assassin Benedetto. Oh, work, work,&mdash;my
        passion, my joy, my delight,&mdash;it is for thee to alleviate my sorrows!&rdquo;
        and he convulsively grasped the hand of d&rsquo;Avrigny.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you require my services now?&rdquo; asked d&rsquo;Avrigny.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Villefort; &ldquo;only return again at eleven o&rsquo;clock;
        at twelve the&mdash;the&mdash;oh, Heavens, my poor, poor child!&rdquo; and
        the procureur again becoming a man, lifted up his eyes and groaned.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall you be present in the reception-room?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; I have a cousin who has undertaken this sad office. I shall
        work, doctor&mdash;when I work I forget everything.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And, indeed, no sooner had the doctor left the room, than he was again absorbed
        in work. On the doorsteps d&rsquo;Avrigny met the cousin whom Villefort had
        mentioned, a personage as insignificant in our story as in the world he
        occupied&mdash;one of those beings designed from their birth to make
        themselves useful to others. He was punctual, dressed in black, with crape
        around his hat, and presented himself at his cousin&rsquo;s with a face
        made up for the occasion, and which he could alter as might be required.
      </p>
      <p>
        At eleven o&rsquo;clock the mourning-coaches rolled into the paved court,
        and the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré was filled with a crowd of idlers,
        equally pleased to witness the festivities or the mourning of the rich,
        and who rush with the same avidity to a funeral procession as to the
        marriage of a duchess.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gradually the reception-room filled, and some of our old friends made
        their appearance&mdash;we mean Debray, Château-Renaud, and Beauchamp,
        accompanied by all the leading men of the day at the bar, in literature,
        or the army, for M. de Villefort moved in the first Parisian circles, less
        owing to his social position than to his personal merit.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cousin standing at the door ushered in the guests, and it was rather a relief
        to the indifferent to see a person as unmoved as themselves, and who did not
        exact a mournful face or force tears, as would have been the case with a
        father, a brother, or a lover. Those who were acquainted soon formed into
        little groups. One of them was made of Debray, Château-Renaud, and
        Beauchamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Poor girl,&rdquo; said Debray, like the rest, paying an involuntary
        tribute to the sad event,&mdash;&ldquo;poor girl, so young, so rich, so
        beautiful! Could you have imagined this scene, Château-Renaud, when we saw
        her, at the most three weeks ago, about to sign that contract?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed, no,&rdquo; said Château-Renaud.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you know her?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I spoke to her once or twice at Madame de Morcerf&rsquo;s, among
        the rest; she appeared to me charming, though rather melancholy. Where is
        her stepmother? Do you know?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;She is spending the day with the wife of the worthy gentleman who
        is receiving us.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50105m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Whom do you mean?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The gentleman who receives us? Is he a deputy?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no. I am condemned to witness those gentlemen every day,&rdquo;
        said Beauchamp; &ldquo;but he is perfectly unknown to me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you mentioned this death in your paper?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It has been mentioned, but the article is not mine; indeed, I doubt
        if it will please M. Villefort, for it says that if four successive deaths
        had happened anywhere else than in the house of the king&rsquo;s attorney,
        he would have interested himself somewhat more about it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said Château-Renaud, &ldquo;Dr. d&rsquo;Avrigny, who
        attends my mother, declares he is in despair about it. But whom are you
        seeking, Debray?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am seeking the Count of Monte Cristo&rdquo; said the young man.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I met him on the boulevard, on my way here,&rdquo; said Beauchamp.
        &ldquo;I think he is about to leave Paris; he was going to his banker.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;His banker? Danglars is his banker, is he not?&rdquo; asked
        Château-Renaud of Debray.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; replied the secretary with slight uneasiness.
        &ldquo;But Monte Cristo is not the only one I miss here; I do not see
        Morrel.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Morrel? Do they know him?&rdquo; asked Château-Renaud. &ldquo;I
        think he has only been introduced to Madame de Villefort.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Still, he ought to have been here,&rdquo; said Debray; &ldquo;I
        wonder what will be talked about tonight; this funeral is the news of the
        day. But hush, here comes our minister of justice; he will feel obliged to
        make some little speech to the cousin,&rdquo; and the three young men drew
        near to listen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beauchamp told the truth when he said that on his way to the funeral he had
        met Monte Cristo, who was directing his steps towards the Rue de la Chaussée
        d&rsquo;Antin, to M. Danglars&rsquo;. The banker saw the carriage of the count
        enter the courtyard, and advanced to meet him with a sad, though affable smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, extending his hand to Monte Cristo, &ldquo;I suppose
        you have come to sympathize with me, for indeed misfortune has taken possession
        of my house. When I perceived you, I was just asking myself whether I had not
        wished harm towards those poor Morcerfs, which would have justified the
        proverb of &lsquo;He who wishes misfortunes to happen to others
        experiences them himself.&rsquo; Well, on my word of honor, I answered,
        &lsquo;No!&rsquo; I wished no ill to Morcerf; he was a little proud,
        perhaps, for a man who like myself has risen from nothing; but we all have
        our faults. Do you know, count, that persons of our time of life&mdash;not
        that you belong to the class, you are still a young man,&mdash;but as I
        was saying, persons of our time of life have been very unfortunate this
        year. For example, look at the puritanical procureur, who has just lost
        his daughter, and in fact nearly all his family, in so singular a manner;
        Morcerf dishonored and dead; and then myself covered with ridicule through
        the villany of Benedetto; besides&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Besides what?&rdquo; asked the Count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas, do you not know?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What new calamity?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My daughter&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mademoiselle Danglars?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Eugénie has left us!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Good heavens, what are you telling me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The truth, my dear count. Oh, how happy you must be in not having
        either wife or children!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed I do.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And so Mademoiselle Danglars&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;She could not endure the insult offered to us by that wretch, so
        she asked permission to travel.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And is she gone?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The other night she left.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With Madame Danglars?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, with a relation. But still, we have quite lost our dear
        Eugénie; for I doubt whether her pride will ever allow her to return to
        France.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Still, baron,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, &ldquo;family griefs, or
        indeed any other affliction which would crush a man whose child was his
        only treasure, are endurable to a millionaire. Philosophers may well say,
        and practical men will always support the opinion, that money mitigates
        many trials; and if you admit the efficacy of this sovereign balm, you
        ought to be very easily consoled&mdash;you, the king of finance, the focus
        of immeasurable power.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars looked at him askance, as though to ascertain whether he spoke
        seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;if a fortune brings consolation,
        I ought to be consoled; I am rich.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So rich, dear sir, that your fortune resembles the pyramids; if you
        wished to demolish them you could not, and if it were possible, you would
        not dare!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars smiled at the good-natured pleasantry of the count. &ldquo;That
        reminds me,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that when you entered I was on the point
        of signing five little bonds; I have already signed two: will you allow me
        to do the same to the others?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Pray do so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a moment&rsquo;s silence, during which the noise of the banker&rsquo;s
        pen was alone heard, while Monte Cristo examined the gilt mouldings on the
        ceiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are they Spanish, Haitian, or Neapolitan bonds?&rdquo; said Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Danglars, smiling, &ldquo;they are bonds on the bank of
        France, payable to bearer. Stay, count,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;you, who may be
        called the emperor, if I claim the title of king of finance, have you many pieces
        of paper of this size, each worth a million?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The count took into his hands the papers, which Danglars had so proudly
        presented to him, and read:&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;To the Governor of the Bank. Please pay to my order, from the fund
        deposited by me, the sum of a million, and charge the same to my account.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Baron Danglars.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;One, two, three, four, five,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo; &ldquo;five
        millions&mdash;why what a Crœsus you are!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This is how I transact business,&rdquo; said Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is really wonderful,&rdquo; said the count; &ldquo;above all,
        if, as I suppose, it is payable at sight.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is, indeed, said Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is a fine thing to have such credit; really, it is only in
        France these things are done. Five millions on five little scraps of
        paper!&mdash;it must be seen to be believed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You do not doubt it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You say so with an accent&mdash;stay, you shall be convinced; take
        my clerk to the bank, and you will see him leave it with an order on the
        Treasury for the same sum.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo folding the five notes, &ldquo;most
        decidedly not; the thing is so curious, I will make the experiment myself.
        I am credited on you for six millions. I have drawn nine hundred thousand
        francs, you therefore still owe me five millions and a hundred thousand
        francs. I will take the five scraps of paper that I now hold as bonds,
        with your signature alone, and here is a receipt in full for the six
        millions between us. I had prepared it beforehand, for I am much in want
        of money today.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And Monte Cristo placed the bonds in his pocket with one hand, while with the
        other he held out the receipt to Danglars. If a thunderbolt had fallen at the
        banker&rsquo;s feet, he could not have experienced greater terror.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;do you mean to keep that money?
        Excuse me, excuse me, but I owe this money to the charity fund,&mdash;a
        deposit which I promised to pay this morning.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, well, then,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, &ldquo;I am not
        particular about these five notes, pay me in a different form; I wished,
        from curiosity, to take these, that I might be able to say that without
        any advice or preparation the house of Danglars had paid me five millions
        without a minute&rsquo;s delay; it would have been remarkable. But here
        are your bonds; pay me differently;&rdquo; and he held the bonds towards
        Danglars, who seized them like a vulture extending its claws to withhold
        the food that is being wrested from its grasp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly he rallied, made a violent effort to restrain himself, and then a
        smile gradually widened the features of his disturbed countenance.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50109m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;your receipt is money.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh dear, yes; and if you were at Rome, the house of Thomson &amp;
        French would make no more difficulty about paying the money on my receipt
        than you have just done.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Pardon me, count, pardon me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then I may keep this money?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Danglars, while the perspiration started from the
        roots of his hair. &ldquo;Yes, keep it&mdash;keep it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo replaced the notes in his pocket with that indescribable
        expression which seemed to say, &ldquo;Come, reflect; if you repent there
        is still time.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Danglars, &ldquo;no, decidedly no; keep my
        signatures. But you know none are so formal as bankers in transacting
        business; I intended this money for the charity fund, and I seemed to be
        robbing them if I did not pay them with these precise bonds. How absurd&mdash;as
        if one crown were not as good as another. Excuse me;&rdquo; and he began
        to laugh loudly, but nervously.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly, I excuse you,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo graciously,
        &ldquo;and pocket them.&rdquo; And he placed the bonds in his pocket-book.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Danglars, &ldquo;there is still a sum of one
        hundred thousand francs?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, a mere nothing,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo. &ldquo;The balance
        would come to about that sum; but keep it, and we shall be quits.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Count,&rdquo; said Danglars, &ldquo;are you speaking seriously?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I never joke with bankers,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo in a freezing
        manner, which repelled impertinence; and he turned to the door, just as
        the valet de chambre announced:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. de Boville, Receiver-General of the charities.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Ma foi</i>,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo; &ldquo;I think I arrived
        just in time to obtain your signatures, or they would have been disputed
        with me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars again became pale, and hastened to conduct the count out. Monte
        Cristo exchanged a ceremonious bow with M. de Boville, who was standing in
        the waiting-room, and who was introduced into Danglars&rsquo; room as soon
        as the count had left.
      </p>
      <p>
        The count&rsquo;s serious face was illumined by a faint smile, as he noticed the
        portfolio which the receiver-general held in his hand. At the door he found his
        carriage, and was immediately driven to the bank. Meanwhile Danglars, repressing
        all emotion, advanced to meet the receiver-general. We need not say that a smile
        of condescension was stamped upon his lips.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Good-morning, creditor,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;for I wager anything
        it is the creditor who visits me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are right, baron,&rdquo; answered M. de Boville; &ldquo;the
        charities present themselves to you through me; the widows and orphans
        depute me to receive alms to the amount of five millions from you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And yet they say orphans are to be pitied,&rdquo; said Danglars,
        wishing to prolong the jest. &ldquo;Poor things!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Here I am in their name,&rdquo; said M. de Boville; &ldquo;but did
        you receive my letter yesterday?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have brought my receipt.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50111m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear M. de Boville, your widows and orphans must oblige me by
        waiting twenty-four hours, since M. de Monte Cristo whom you just saw
        leaving here&mdash;you did see him, I think?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; well?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, M. de Monte Cristo has just carried off their five millions.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The count has an unlimited credit upon me; a credit opened by
        Thomson &amp; French, of Rome; he came to demand five millions at once,
        which I paid him with checks on the bank. My funds are deposited there,
        and you can understand that if I draw out ten millions on the same day it
        will appear rather strange to the governor. Two days will be a different
        thing,&rdquo; said Danglars, smiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Boville, with a tone of entire incredulity,
        &ldquo;five millions to that gentleman who just left, and who bowed to me
        as though he knew me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps he knows you, though you do not know him; M. de Monte
        Cristo knows everybody.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Five millions!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Here is his receipt. Believe your own eyes.&rdquo; M. de Boville
        took the paper Danglars presented him, and read:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Received of Baron Danglars the sum of five million one hundred
        thousand francs, to be repaid on demand by the house of Thomson &amp;
        French of Rome.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is really true,&rdquo; said M. de Boville.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know the house of Thomson &amp; French?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I once had business to transact with it to the amount of
        200,000 francs; but since then I have not heard it mentioned.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is one of the best houses in Europe,&rdquo; said Danglars,
        carelessly throwing down the receipt on his desk.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And he had five millions in your hands alone! Why, this Count of
        Monte Cristo must be a nabob?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed I do not know what he is; he has three unlimited credits&mdash;one
        on me, one on Rothschild, one on Lafitte; and, you see,&rdquo; he added
        carelessly, &ldquo;he has given me the preference, by leaving a balance of
        100,000 francs.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        M. de Boville manifested signs of extraordinary admiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I must visit him,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and obtain some pious grant
        from him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, you may make sure of him; his charities alone amount to 20,000
        francs a month.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is magnificent! I will set before him the example of Madame de
        Morcerf and her son.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What example?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They gave all their fortune to the hospitals.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What fortune?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Their own&mdash;M. de Morcerf&rsquo;s, who is deceased.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;For what reason?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because they would not spend money so guiltily acquired.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what are they to live upon?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The mother retires into the country, and the son enters the army.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50113m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I must confess, these are scruples.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I registered their deed of gift yesterday.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And how much did they possess?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, not much&mdash;from twelve to thirteen hundred thousand francs.
        But to return to our millions.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Danglars, in the most natural tone in the
        world. &ldquo;Are you then pressed for this money?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; for the examination of our cash takes place tomorrow.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Tomorrow? Why did you not tell me so before? Why, it is as good as
        a century! At what hour does the examination take place?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At two o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Send at twelve,&rdquo; said Danglars, smiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        M. de Boville said nothing, but nodded his head, and took up the portfolio.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now I think of it, you can do better,&rdquo; said Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How do you mean?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The receipt of M. de Monte Cristo is as good as money; take it to
        Rothschild&rsquo;s or Lafitte&rsquo;s, and they will take it off your
        hands at once.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What, though payable at Rome?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly; it will only cost you a discount of 5,000 or 6,000
        francs.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The receiver started back.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Ma foi!</i>&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I prefer waiting till tomorrow.
        What a proposition!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I thought, perhaps,&rdquo; said Danglars with supreme impertinence,
        &ldquo;that you had a deficiency to make up?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said the receiver.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And if that were the case it would be worth while to make some
        sacrifice.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you, no, sir.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then it will be tomorrow.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; but without fail.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, you are laughing at me; send tomorrow at twelve, and the bank
        shall be notified.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will come myself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Better still, since it will afford me the pleasure of seeing you.&rdquo;
        They shook hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said M. de Boville, &ldquo;are you not going to the
        funeral of poor Mademoiselle de Villefort, which I met on my road here?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the banker; &ldquo;I have appeared rather
        ridiculous since that affair of Benedetto, so I remain in the background.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bah, you are wrong. How were you to blame in that affair?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen&mdash;when one bears an irreproachable name, as I do, one is
        rather sensitive.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Everybody pities you, sir; and, above all, Mademoiselle Danglars!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Poor Eugénie!&rdquo; said Danglars; &ldquo;do you know she is going
        to embrace a religious life?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas, it is unhappily but too true. The day after the event, she
        decided on leaving Paris with a nun of her acquaintance; they are gone to
        seek a very strict convent in Italy or Spain.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, it is terrible!&rdquo; and M. de Boville retired with this
        exclamation, after expressing acute sympathy with the father. But he had
        scarcely left before Danglars, with an energy of action those can alone
        understand who have seen Robert Macaire represented by
        Frédérick,<a href="#linknote-24" name="linknoteref-24" id="linknoteref-24">24</a>
        exclaimed:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Fool!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Then enclosing Monte Cristo&rsquo;s receipt in a little pocket-book, he
        added:&mdash;&ldquo;Yes, come at twelve o&rsquo;clock; I shall then be far
        away.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he double-locked his door, emptied all his drawers, collected about fifty
        thousand francs in bank-notes, burned several papers, left others exposed to
        view, and then commenced writing a letter which he addressed:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To Madame la Baronne Danglars.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will place it on her table myself tonight,&rdquo; he murmured.
        Then taking a passport from his drawer he said,&mdash;&ldquo;Good, it is
        available for two months longer.&rdquo;
