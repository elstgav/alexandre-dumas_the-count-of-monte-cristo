      <h2>Chapter 48. Ideology</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>f the Count of
        Monte Cristo had been for a long time familiar with the ways of Parisian
        society, he would have appreciated better the significance of the step
        which M. de Villefort had taken. Standing well at court, whether the king
        regnant was of the older or younger branch, whether the government was
        doctrinaire liberal, or conservative; looked upon by all as a man of
        talent, since those who have never experienced a political check are
        generally so regarded; hated by many, but warmly supported by others,
        without being really liked by anybody, M. de Villefort held a high
        position in the magistracy, and maintained his eminence like a Harlay or a
        Mol√©. His drawing-room, under the regenerating influence of a young wife
        and a daughter by his first marriage, scarcely eighteen, was still one of
        the well-regulated Paris salons where the worship of traditional customs
        and the observance of rigid etiquette were carefully maintained. A
        freezing politeness, a strict fidelity to government principles, a
        profound contempt for theories and theorists, a deep-seated hatred of
        ideality,&mdash;these were the elements of private and public life
        displayed by M. de Villefort.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30023m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        M. de Villefort was not only a magistrate, he was almost a diplomatist.
        His relations with the former court, of which he always spoke with dignity
        and respect, made him respected by the new one, and he knew so many
        things, that not only was he always carefully considered, but sometimes
        consulted. Perhaps this would not have been so had it been possible to get
        rid of M. de Villefort; but, like the feudal barons who rebelled against
        their sovereign, he dwelt in an impregnable fortress. This fortress was
        his post as king&rsquo;s attorney, all the advantages of which he
        exploited with marvellous skill, and which he would not have resigned but
        to be made deputy, and thus to replace neutrality by opposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ordinarily M. de Villefort made and returned very few visits. His wife
        visited for him, and this was the received thing in the world, where the
        weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an
        excuse for what was really only calculated pride, a manifestation of
        professed superiority&mdash;in fact, the application of the axiom, <i>Pretend
        to think well of yourself, and the world will think well of you</i>, an
        axiom a hundred times more useful in society nowadays than that of the
        Greeks, &ldquo;Know thyself,&rdquo; a knowledge for which, in our days, we
        have substituted the less difficult and more advantageous science of <i>knowing
        others</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To his friends M. de Villefort was a powerful protector; to his enemies,
        he was a silent, but bitter opponent; for those who were neither the one
        nor the other, he was a statue of the law-made man. He had a haughty
        bearing, a look either steady and impenetrable or insolently piercing and
        inquisitorial. Four successive revolutions had built and cemented the
        pedestal upon which his fortune was based.
      </p>
      <p>
        M. de Villefort had the reputation of being the least curious and the least
        wearisome man in France. He gave a ball every year, at which he appeared for a
        quarter of an hour only,&mdash;that is to say, five-and-forty minutes less than
        the king is visible at his balls. He was never seen at the theatres, at
        concerts, or in any place of public resort. Occasionally, but seldom, he
        played at whist, and then care was taken to select partners worthy of
        him&mdash;sometimes they were ambassadors, sometimes archbishops, or sometimes a
        prince, or a president, or some dowager duchess.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such was the man whose carriage had just now stopped before the Count of Monte
        Cristo&rsquo;s door. The valet de chambre announced M. de Villefort at the moment
        when the count, leaning over a large table, was tracing on a map the route from
        St. Petersburg to China.
      </p>
      <p>
        The procureur entered with the same grave and measured step he would have
        employed in entering a court of justice. He was the same man, or rather
        the development of the same man, whom we have heretofore seen as assistant
        attorney at Marseilles. Nature, according to her way, had made no
        deviation in the path he had marked out for himself. From being slender he
        had now become meagre; once pale, he was now yellow; his deep-set eyes
        were hollow, and the gold spectacles shielding his eyes seemed to be an
        integral portion of his face. He dressed entirely in black, with the
        exception of his white tie, and his funeral appearance was only mitigated
        by the slight line of red ribbon which passed almost imperceptibly through
        his button-hole, and appeared like a streak of blood traced with a delicate brush.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although master of himself, Monte Cristo, scrutinized with irrepressible curiosity
        the magistrate whose salute he returned, and who, distrustful by habit, and
        especially incredulous as to social prodigies, was much more despised to look
        upon &ldquo;the noble stranger,&rdquo; as Monte Cristo was already called, as an
        adventurer in search of new fields, or an escaped criminal, rather than as a
        prince of the Holy See, or a sultan of the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Villefort, in the squeaky tone assumed by
        magistrates in their oratorical periods, and of which they cannot, or will
        not, divest themselves in society, &ldquo;sir, the signal service which
        you yesterday rendered to my wife and son has made it a duty for me to
        offer you my thanks. I have come, therefore, to discharge this duty, and
        to express to you my overwhelming gratitude.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And as he said this, the &ldquo;eye severe&rdquo; of the magistrate had lost
        nothing of its habitual arrogance. He spoke in a voice of the procureur-general,
        with the rigid inflexibility of neck and shoulders which caused his flatterers to
        say (as we have before observed) that he was the living statue of the law.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; replied the count, with a chilling air, &ldquo;I
        am very happy to have been the means of preserving a son to his mother,
        for they say that the sentiment of maternity is the most holy of all; and
        the good fortune which occurred to me, monsieur, might have enabled you to
        dispense with a duty which, in its discharge, confers an undoubtedly great
        honor; for I am aware that M. de Villefort is not usually lavish of the
        favor which he now bestows on me,&mdash;a favor which, however estimable,
        is unequal to the satisfaction which I have in my own consciousness.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort, astonished at this reply, which he by no means expected,
        started like a soldier who feels the blow levelled at him over the armor
        he wears, and a curl of his disdainful lip indicated that from that moment
        he noted in the tablets of his brain that the Count of Monte Cristo was by
        no means a highly bred gentleman.
      </p>
      <p>
        He glanced around, in order to seize on something on which the conversation might
        turn, and seemed to fall easily on a topic. He saw the map which Monte Cristo had
        been examining when he entered, and said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You seem geographically engaged, sir? It is a rich study for you, who, as
        I learn, have seen as many lands as are delineated on this map.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the count; &ldquo;I have sought to make of
        the human race, taken in the mass, what you practice every day on
        individuals&mdash;a physiological study. I have believed it was much
        easier to descend from the whole to a part than to ascend from a part to
        the whole. It is an algebraic axiom, which makes us proceed from a known
        to an unknown quantity, and not from an unknown to a known; but sit down,
        sir, I beg of you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo pointed to a chair, which the procureur was obliged to take
        the trouble to move forwards himself, while the count merely fell back
        into his own, on which he had been kneeling when M. Villefort entered.
        Thus the count was halfway turned towards his visitor, having his back
        towards the window, his elbow resting on the geographical chart which
        furnished the theme of conversation for the moment,&mdash;a conversation
        which assumed, as in the case of the interviews with Danglars and Morcerf,
        a turn analogous to the persons, if not to the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, you philosophize,&rdquo; replied Villefort, after a moment&rsquo;s
        silence, during which, like a wrestler who encounters a powerful opponent, he took
        breath; &ldquo;well, sir, really, if, like you, I had nothing else to do,
        I should seek a more amusing occupation.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, in truth, sir,&rdquo; was Monte Cristo&rsquo;s reply, &ldquo;man
        is but an ugly caterpillar for him who studies him through a solar
        microscope; but you said, I think, that I had nothing else to do. Now,
        really, let me ask, sir, have you?&mdash;do you believe you have anything
        to do? or to speak in plain terms, do you really think that what you do
        deserves being called anything?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort&rsquo;s astonishment redoubled at this second thrust so forcibly
        made by his strange adversary. It was a long time since the magistrate had
        heard a paradox so strong, or rather, to say the truth more exactly, it
        was the first time he had ever heard of it. The procureur exerted himself
        to reply.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he responded, &ldquo;you are a stranger, and I believe you say
        yourself that a portion of your life has been spent in Oriental countries, so you
        are not aware how human justice, so expeditious in barbarous countries, takes
        with us a prudent and well-studied course.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes&mdash;yes, I do, sir; it is the <i>pede claudo</i> of the
        ancients. I know all that, for it is with the justice of all countries
        especially that I have occupied myself&mdash;it is with the criminal
        procedure of all nations that I have compared natural justice, and I must
        say, sir, that it is the law of primitive nations, that is, the law of
        retaliation, that I have most frequently found to be according to the law
        of God.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If this law were adopted, sir,&rdquo; said the procureur, &ldquo;it
        would greatly simplify our legal codes, and in that case the magistrates
        would not (as you just observed) have much to do.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It may, perhaps, come to this in time,&rdquo; observed Monte
        Cristo; &ldquo;you know that human inventions march from the complex to
        the simple, and simplicity is always perfection.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In the meanwhile,&rdquo; continued the magistrate, &ldquo;our codes
        are in full force, with all their contradictory enactments derived from
        Gallic customs, Roman laws, and Frank usages; the knowledge of all which,
        you will agree, is not to be acquired without extended labor; it needs
        tedious study to acquire this knowledge, and, when acquired, a strong
        power of brain to retain it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I agree with you entirely, sir; but all that even you know with
        respect to the French code, I know, not only in reference to that code,
        but as regards the codes of all nations. The English, Turkish, Japanese,
        Hindu laws, are as familiar to me as the French laws, and thus I was
        right, when I said to you, that relatively (you know that everything is
        relative, sir)&mdash;that relatively to what I have done, you have very
        little to do; but that relatively to all I have learned, you have yet a
        great deal to learn.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But with what motive have you learned all this?&rdquo; inquired
        Villefort, in astonishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo smiled.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Really, sir,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;I see that in spite of the
        reputation which you have acquired as a superior man, you look at everything from
        the material and vulgar view of society, beginning with man, and ending with
        man&mdash;that is to say, in the most restricted, most narrow view which it is
        possible for human understanding to embrace.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Pray, sir, explain yourself,&rdquo; said Villefort, more and more
        astonished, &ldquo;I really do&mdash;not&mdash;understand you&mdash;perfectly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I say, sir, that with the eyes fixed on the social organization of
        nations, you see only the springs of the machine, and lose sight of the
        sublime workman who makes them act; I say that you do not recognize before
        you and around you any but those office-holders whose commissions have
        been signed by a minister or king; and that the men whom God has put above
        those office-holders, ministers, and kings, by giving them a mission to
        follow out, instead of a post to fill&mdash;I say that they escape your
        narrow, limited field of observation. It is thus that human weakness
        fails, from its debilitated and imperfect organs. Tobias took the angel
        who restored him to light for an ordinary young man. The nations took
        Attila, who was doomed to destroy them, for a conqueror similar to other
        conquerors, and it was necessary for both to reveal their missions, that
        they might be known and acknowledged; one was compelled to say, &lsquo;I
        am the angel of the Lord&rsquo;; and the other, &lsquo;I am the hammer of
        God,&rsquo; in order that the divine essence in both might be revealed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Villefort, more and more amazed, and really
        supposing he was speaking to a mystic or a madman, &ldquo;you consider
        yourself as one of those extraordinary beings whom you have mentioned?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And why not?&rdquo; said Monte Cristo coldly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your pardon, sir,&rdquo; replied Villefort, quite astounded,
        &ldquo;but you will excuse me if, when I presented myself to you, I was
        unaware that I should meet with a person whose knowledge and understanding
        so far surpass the usual knowledge and understanding of men. It is not
        usual with us corrupted wretches of civilization to find gentlemen like
        yourself, possessors, as you are, of immense fortune&mdash;at least, so it
        is said&mdash;and I beg you to observe that I do not inquire, I merely
        repeat;&mdash;it is not usual, I say, for such privileged and wealthy
        beings to waste their time in speculations on the state of society, in
        philosophical reveries, intended at best to console those whom fate has
        disinherited from the goods of this world.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Really, sir,&rdquo; retorted the count, &ldquo;have you attained
        the eminent situation in which you are, without having admitted, or even
        without having met with exceptions? and do you never use your eyes, which
        must have acquired so much <i>finesse</i> and certainty, to divine, at a
        glance, the kind of man by whom you are confronted? Should not a
        magistrate be not merely the best administrator of the law, but the most
        crafty expounder of the chicanery of his profession, a steel probe to
        search hearts, a touchstone to try the gold which in each soul is mingled
        with more or less of alloy?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Villefort, &ldquo;upon my word, you overcome me. I
        really never heard a person speak as you do.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because you remain eternally encircled in a round of general
        conditions, and have never dared to raise your wings into those upper
        spheres which God has peopled with invisible or exceptional beings.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you allow then, sir, that spheres exist, and that these marked
        and invisible beings mingle amongst us?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why should they not? Can you see the air you breathe, and yet
        without which you could not for a moment exist?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then we do not see those beings to whom you allude?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, we do; you see them whenever God pleases to allow them to
        assume a material form. You touch them, come in contact with them, speak
        to them, and they reply to you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Villefort, smiling, &ldquo;I confess I should like
        to be warned when one of these beings is in contact with me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have been served as you desire, monsieur, for you were warned
        just now, and I now again warn you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you yourself are one of these marked beings?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, monsieur, I believe so; for until now, no man has found
        himself in a position similar to mine. The dominions of kings are limited
        either by mountains or rivers, or a change of manners, or an alteration of
        language. My kingdom is bounded only by the world, for I am not an
        Italian, or a Frenchman, or a Hindu, or an American, or a Spaniard&mdash;I
        am a cosmopolite. No country can say it saw my birth. God alone knows what
        country will see me die. I adopt all customs, speak all languages. You
        believe me to be a Frenchman, for I speak French with the same facility
        and purity as yourself. Well, Ali, my Nubian, believes me to be an Arab;
        Bertuccio, my steward, takes me for a Roman; Hayd√©e, my slave, thinks me a
        Greek. You may, therefore, comprehend, that being of no country, asking no
        protection from any government, acknowledging no man as my brother, not
        one of the scruples that arrest the powerful, or the obstacles which
        paralyze the weak, paralyzes or arrests me. I have only two adversaries&mdash;I
        will not say two conquerors, for with perseverance I subdue even them,&mdash;they
        are time and distance. There is a third, and the most terrible&mdash;that
        is my condition as a mortal being. This alone can stop me in my onward
        career, before I have attained the goal at which I aim, for all the rest I
        have reduced to mathematical terms. What men call the chances of fate&mdash;namely,
        ruin, change, circumstances&mdash;I have fully anticipated, and if any of
        these should overtake me, yet it will not overwhelm me. Unless I die, I
        shall always be what I am, and therefore it is that I utter the things you
        have never heard, even from the mouths of kings&mdash;for kings have need,
        and other persons have fear of you. For who is there who does not say to
        himself, in a society as incongruously organized as ours, &lsquo;Perhaps
        some day I shall have to do with the king&rsquo;s attorney&rsquo;?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But can you not say that, sir? The moment you become an inhabitant
        of France, you are naturally subjected to the French law.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I know it sir,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo; &ldquo;but when I visit
        a country I begin to study, by all the means which are available, the men
        from whom I may have anything to hope or to fear, till I know them as well
        as, perhaps better than, they know themselves. It follows from this, that
        the king&rsquo;s attorney, be he who he may, with whom I should have to
        deal, would assuredly be more embarrassed than I should.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is to say,&rdquo; replied Villefort with hesitation, &ldquo;that
        human nature being weak, every man, according to your creed, has committed
        faults.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Faults or crimes,&rdquo; responded Monte Cristo with a negligent
        air.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And that you alone, amongst the men whom you do not recognize as
        your brothers&mdash;for you have said so,&rdquo; observed Villefort in a
        tone that faltered somewhat&mdash;&ldquo;you alone are perfect.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, not perfect,&rdquo; was the count&rsquo;s reply; &ldquo;only
        impenetrable, that&rsquo;s all. But let us leave off this strain, sir, if
        the tone of it is displeasing to you; I am no more disturbed by your
        justice than are you by my second-sight.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no,&mdash;by no means,&rdquo; said Villefort, who was afraid of
        seeming to abandon his ground. &ldquo;No; by your brilliant and almost
        sublime conversation you have elevated me above the ordinary level; we no
        longer talk, we rise to dissertation. But you know how the theologians in
        their collegiate chairs, and philosophers in their controversies,
        occasionally say cruel truths; let us suppose for the moment that we are
        theologizing in a social way, or even philosophically, and I will say to
        you, rude as it may seem, &lsquo;My brother, you sacrifice greatly to
        pride; you may be above others, but above you there is God.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30029m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Above us all, sir,&rdquo; was Monte Cristo&rsquo;s response, in a
        tone and with an emphasis so deep that Villefort involuntarily shuddered.
        &ldquo;I have my pride for men&mdash;serpents always ready to threaten
        everyone who would pass without crushing them under foot. But I lay aside
        that pride before God, who has taken me from nothing to make me what I am.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then, count, I admire you,&rdquo; said Villefort, who, for the
        first time in this strange conversation, used the aristocratic form to the
        unknown personage, whom, until now, he had only called monsieur. &ldquo;Yes,
        and I say to you, if you are really strong, really superior, really pious,
        or impenetrable, which you were right in saying amounts to the same thing&mdash;then
        be proud, sir, for that is the characteristic of predominance. Yet you
        have unquestionably some ambition.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have, sir.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what may it be?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I too, as happens to every man once in his life, have been taken by
        Satan into the highest mountain in the earth, and when there he showed me
        all the kingdoms of the world, and as he said before, so said he to me,
        &lsquo;Child of earth, what wouldst thou have to make thee adore me?&rsquo;
        I reflected long, for a gnawing ambition had long preyed upon me, and then
        I replied, &lsquo;Listen,&mdash;I have always heard of Providence, and yet
        I have never seen him, or anything that resembles him, or which can make
        me believe that he exists. I wish to be Providence myself, for I feel that
        the most beautiful, noblest, most sublime thing in the world, is to
        recompense and punish.&rsquo; Satan bowed his head, and groaned. &lsquo;You
        mistake,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Providence does exist, only you have never
        seen him, because the child of God is as invisible as the parent. You have
        seen nothing that resembles him, because he works by secret springs, and
        moves by hidden ways. All I can do for you is to make you one of the
        agents of that Providence.&rsquo; The bargain was concluded. I may
        sacrifice my soul, but what matters it?&rdquo; added Monte Cristo. &ldquo;If
        the thing were to do again, I would again do it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort looked at Monte Cristo with extreme amazement.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Count,&rdquo; he inquired, &ldquo;have you any relations?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, sir, I am alone in the world.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So much the worse.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because then you might witness a spectacle calculated to break down
        your pride. You say you fear nothing but death?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I did not say that I feared it; I only said that death alone could
        check the execution of my plans.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And old age?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My end will be achieved before I grow old.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And madness?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have been nearly mad; and you know the axiom,&mdash;<i>non bis in
        idem</i>. It is an axiom of criminal law, and, consequently, you
        understand its full application.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30031m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; continued Villefort, &ldquo;there is something to fear
        besides death, old age, and madness. For instance, there is apoplexy&mdash;that
        lightning-stroke which strikes but does not destroy you, and yet which
        brings everything to an end. You are still yourself as now, and yet you
        are yourself no longer; you who, like Ariel, verge on the angelic, are but
        an inert mass, which, like Caliban, verges on the brutal; and this is
        called in human tongues, as I tell you, neither more nor less than
        apoplexy. Come, if so you will, count, and continue this conversation at
        my house, any day you may be willing to see an adversary capable of
        understanding and anxious to refute you, and I will show you my father, M.
        Noirtier de Villefort, one of the most fiery Jacobins of the French
        Revolution; that is to say, he had the most remarkable audacity, seconded
        by a most powerful organization&mdash;a man who has not, perhaps, like
        yourself seen all the kingdoms of the earth, but who has helped to
        overturn one of the greatest; in fact, a man who believed himself, like
        you, one of the envoys, not of God, but of a supreme being; not of
        Providence, but of fate. Well, sir, the rupture of a blood-vessel on the
        lobe of the brain has destroyed all this, not in a day, not in an hour,
        but in a second. M. Noirtier, who, on the previous night, was the old
        Jacobin, the old senator, the old Carbonaro, laughing at the guillotine,
        the cannon, and the dagger&mdash;M. Noirtier, playing with revolutions&mdash;M.
        Noirtier, for whom France was a vast chess-board, from which pawns, rooks,
        knights, and queens were to disappear, so that the king was checkmated&mdash;M.
        Noirtier, the redoubtable, was the next morning <i>poor M. Noirtier</i>,
        the helpless old man, at the tender mercies of the weakest creature in the
        household, that is, his grandchild, Valentine; a dumb and frozen carcass,
        in fact, living painlessly on, that time may be given for his frame to
        decompose without his consciousness of its decay.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas, sir,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo &ldquo;this spectacle is
        neither strange to my eye nor my thought. I am something of a physician,
        and have, like my fellows, sought more than once for the soul in living
        and in dead matter; yet, like Providence, it has remained invisible to my
        eyes, although present to my heart. A hundred writers since Socrates,
        Seneca, St. Augustine, and Gall, have made, in verse and prose, the
        comparison you have made, and yet I can well understand that a father&rsquo;s
        sufferings may effect great changes in the mind of a son. I will call on
        you, sir, since you bid me contemplate, for the advantage of my pride,
        this terrible spectacle, which must have been so great a source of sorrow
        to your family.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It would have been so unquestionably, had not God given me so large
        a compensation. In contrast with the old man, who is dragging his way to
        the tomb, are two children just entering into life&mdash;Valentine, the
        daughter by my first wife&mdash;Mademoiselle Ren√©e de Saint-M√©ran&mdash;and
        Edward, the boy whose life you have this day saved.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what is your deduction from this compensation, sir?&rdquo;
        inquired Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My deduction is,&rdquo; replied Villefort, &ldquo;that my father,
        led away by his passions, has committed some fault unknown to human
        justice, but marked by the justice of God. That God, desirous in his mercy
        to punish but one person, has visited this justice on him alone.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo with a smile on his lips, uttered in the depths of his soul a
        groan which would have made Villefort fly had he but heard it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Adieu, sir,&rdquo; said the magistrate, who had risen from his seat;
        &ldquo;I leave you, bearing a remembrance of you&mdash;a remembrance of esteem,
        which I hope will not be disagreeable to you when you know me better; for
        I am not a man to bore my friends, as you will learn. Besides, you have
        made an eternal friend of Madame de Villefort.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The count bowed, and contented himself with seeing Villefort to the door of his
        cabinet, the procureur being escorted to his carriage by two footmen, who, on a
        signal from their master, followed him with every mark of attention. When he had
        gone, Monte Cristo breathed a profound sigh, and said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Enough of this poison, let me now seek the antidote.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Then sounding his bell, he said to Ali, who entered:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am going to madame&rsquo;s chamber&mdash;have the carriage ready at
        one o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
