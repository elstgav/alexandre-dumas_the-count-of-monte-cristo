      <h2>Chapter 55. Major Cavalcanti</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>oth the count and
        Baptistin had told the truth when they announced to Morcerf the proposed
        visit of the major, which had served Monte Cristo as a pretext for
        declining Albert&rsquo;s invitation. Seven o&rsquo;clock had just struck,
        and M. Bertuccio, according to the command which had been given him, had
        two hours before left for Auteuil, when a cab stopped at the door, and
        after depositing its occupant at the gate, immediately hurried away, as if
        ashamed of its employment. The visitor was about fifty-two years of age,
        dressed in one of the green surtouts, ornamented with black frogs, which
        have so long maintained their popularity all over Europe. He wore trousers
        of blue cloth, boots tolerably clean, but not of the brightest polish, and
        a little too thick in the soles, buckskin gloves, a hat somewhat
        resembling in shape those usually worn by the gendarmes, and a black
        cravat striped with white, which, if the proprietor had not worn it of his
        own free will, might have passed for a halter, so much did it resemble
        one. Such was the picturesque costume of the person who rang at the gate,
        and demanded if it was not at No. 30 in the Avenue des Champs-Élysées that
        the Count of Monte Cristo lived, and who, being answered by the porter in
        the affirmative, entered, closed the gate after him, and began to ascend
        the steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        The small and angular head of this man, his white hair and thick gray
        moustaches, caused him to be easily recognized by Baptistin, who had
        received an exact description of the expected visitor, and who was
        awaiting him in the hall. Therefore, scarcely had the stranger time to
        pronounce his name before the count was apprised of his arrival. He was
        ushered into a simple and elegant drawing-room, and the count rose to meet
        him with a smiling air.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, my dear sir, you are most welcome; I was expecting you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said the Italian, &ldquo;was your excellency then
        aware of my visit?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; I had been told that I should see you today at seven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you have received full information concerning my arrival?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, so much the better, I feared this little precaution might have
        been forgotten.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30119m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What precaution?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That of informing you beforehand of my coming.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, it has not.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But you are sure you are not mistaken.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very sure.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It really was I whom your excellency expected at seven o&rsquo;clock
        this evening?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will prove it to you beyond a doubt.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, never mind that,&rdquo; said the Italian; &ldquo;it is not
        worth the trouble.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo. His visitor appeared slightly
        uneasy. &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said the count; &ldquo;are you not the
        Marquis Bartolomeo Cavalcanti?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bartolomeo Cavalcanti,&rdquo; joyfully replied the Italian; &ldquo;yes,
        I am really he.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ex-major in the Austrian service?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Was I a major?&rdquo; timidly asked the old soldier.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo &ldquo;you were a major; that is the
        title the French give to the post which you filled in Italy.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the major, &ldquo;I do not demand more, you
        understand&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your visit here today is not of your own suggestion, is it?&rdquo;
        said Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, certainly not.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You were sent by some other person?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By the excellent Abbé Busoni?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Exactly so,&rdquo; said the delighted major.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you have a letter?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, there it is.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Give it to me, then.&rdquo; And Monte Cristo took the letter, which
        he opened and read. The major looked at the count with his large staring
        eyes, and then took a survey of the apartment, but his gaze almost
        immediately reverted to the proprietor of the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, I see. &lsquo;Major Cavalcanti, a worthy patrician of
        Lucca, a descendant of the Cavalcanti of Florence,&rsquo;&rdquo; continued
        Monte Cristo, reading aloud, &ldquo;&lsquo;possessing an income of half a
        million.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo raised his eyes from the paper, and bowed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Half a million,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;magnificent!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Half a million, is it?&rdquo; said the major.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, in so many words; and it must be so, for the abbé knows
        correctly the amount of all the largest fortunes in Europe.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Be it half a million, then; but on my word of honor, I had no idea
        that it was so much.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because you are robbed by your steward. You must make some
        reformation in that quarter.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have opened my eyes,&rdquo; said the Italian gravely; &ldquo;I
        will show the gentlemen the door.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo resumed the perusal of the letter:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;And who only needs one thing more to make him happy.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, indeed but one!&rdquo; said the major with a sigh.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Which is to recover a lost and adored son.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A lost and adored son!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Stolen away in his infancy, either by an enemy of his noble
        family or by the gypsies.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At the age of five years!&rdquo; said the major with a deep sigh,
        and raising his eye to heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Unhappy father,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo. The count continued:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;I have given him renewed life and hope, in the assurance
        that you have the power of restoring the son whom he has vainly sought for
        fifteen years.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The major looked at the count with an indescribable expression of anxiety.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have the power of so doing,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo. The major
        recovered his self-possession.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So, then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the letter was true to the end?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you doubt it, my dear Monsieur Bartolomeo?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, indeed; certainly not; a good man, a man holding religious
        office, as does the Abbé Busoni, could not condescend to deceive or play
        off a joke; but your excellency has not read all.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, true,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo &ldquo;there is a postscript.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; repeated the major, &ldquo;yes&mdash;there&mdash;is&mdash;a&mdash;postscript.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;In order to save Major Cavalcanti the trouble of drawing on
        his banker, I send him a draft for 2,000 francs to defray his travelling
        expenses, and credit on you for the further sum of 48,000 francs, which
        you still owe me.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The major awaited the conclusion of the postscript, apparently with great
        anxiety.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He said &lsquo;very good,&rsquo;&rdquo; muttered the major, &ldquo;then&mdash;sir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
        replied he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then what?&rdquo; asked Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then the postscript&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well; what of the postscript?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then the postscript is as favorably received by you as the rest of
        the letter?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly; the Abbé Busoni and myself have a small account open
        between us. I do not remember if it is exactly 48,000 francs, which I am
        still owing him, but I dare say we shall not dispute the difference. You
        attached great importance, then, to this postscript, my dear Monsieur
        Cavalcanti?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I must explain to you,&rdquo; said the major, &ldquo;that, fully
        confiding in the signature of the Abbé Busoni, I had not provided myself
        with any other funds; so that if this resource had failed me, I should
        have found myself very unpleasantly situated in Paris.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is it possible that a man of your standing should be embarrassed
        anywhere?&rdquo; said Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, really I know no one,&rdquo; said the major.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But then you yourself are known to others?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I am known, so that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Proceed, my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So that you will remit to me these 48,000 francs?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly, at your first request.&rdquo; The major&rsquo;s eyes
        dilated with pleasing astonishment. &ldquo;But sit down,&rdquo; said Monte
        Cristo; &ldquo;really I do not know what I have been thinking of&mdash;I
        have positively kept you standing for the last quarter of an hour.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mention it.&rdquo; The major drew an armchair towards
        him, and proceeded to seat himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;what will you take&mdash;a glass
        of sherry, port, or Alicante?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alicante, if you please; it is my favorite wine.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have some that is very good. You will take a biscuit with it,
        will you not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I will take a biscuit, as you are so obliging.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo rang; Baptistin appeared. The count advanced to meet him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; said he in a low voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The young man is here,&rdquo; said the valet de chambre in the same
        tone.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Into what room did you take him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Into the blue drawing-room, according to your excellency&rsquo;s
        orders.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right; now bring the Alicante and some biscuits.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Baptistin left the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said the major, &ldquo;I am quite ashamed of the trouble
        I am giving you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Pray don&rsquo;t mention such a thing,&rdquo; said the count.
        Baptistin re-entered with glasses, wine, and biscuits. The count filled
        one glass, but in the other he only poured a few drops of the ruby-colored
        liquid. The bottle was covered with spiders&rsquo; webs, and all the other
        signs which indicate the age of wine more truly than do wrinkles on a man&rsquo;s
        face. The major made a wise choice; he took the full glass and a biscuit.
        The count told Baptistin to leave the plate within reach of his guest, who
        began by sipping the Alicante with an expression of great satisfaction,
        and then delicately steeped his biscuit in the wine.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30123m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So, sir, you lived at Lucca, did you? You were rich, noble, held in
        great esteem&mdash;had all that could render a man happy?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;All,&rdquo; said the major, hastily swallowing his biscuit, &ldquo;positively
        all.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And yet there was one thing wanting in order to complete your
        happiness?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Only one thing,&rdquo; said the Italian.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And that one thing, your lost child.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the major, taking a second biscuit, &ldquo;that
        consummation of my happiness was indeed wanting.&rdquo; The worthy major
        raised his eyes to heaven and sighed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let me hear, then,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;who this deeply
        regretted son was; for I always understood you were a bachelor.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That was the general opinion, sir,&rdquo; said the major, &ldquo;and
        I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the count, &ldquo;and you confirmed the report.
        A youthful indiscretion, I suppose, which you were anxious to conceal from
        the world at large?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The major recovered himself, and resumed his usual calm manner, at the same time
        casting his eyes down, either to give himself time to compose his countenance, or
        to assist his imagination, all the while giving an under-look at the count, the
        protracted smile on whose lips still announced the same polite curiosity.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the major, &ldquo;I did wish this fault to be hidden from
        every eye.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not on your own account, surely,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo;
        &ldquo;for a man is above that sort of thing?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, certainly not on my own account,&rdquo; said the major with
        a smile and a shake of the head.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But for the sake of the mother?&rdquo; said the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, for the mother&rsquo;s sake&mdash;his poor mother!&rdquo;
        cried the major, taking a third biscuit.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Take some more wine, my dear Cavalcanti,&rdquo; said the count,
        pouring out for him a second glass of Alicante; &ldquo;your emotion has
        quite overcome you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;His poor mother,&rdquo; murmured the major, trying to get the
        lachrymal gland in operation, so as to moisten the corner of his eye with
        a false tear.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;She belonged to one of the first families in Italy, I think, did
        she not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;She was of a noble family of Fiesole, count.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And her name was&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you desire to know her name&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo &ldquo;it would be quite superfluous
        for you to tell me, for I already know it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The count knows everything,&rdquo; said the Italian, bowing.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oliva Corsinari, was it not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oliva Corsinari!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A marchioness?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A marchioness!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you married her at last, notwithstanding the opposition of her
        family?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, that was the way it ended.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you have doubtless brought all your papers with you?&rdquo;
        said Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What papers?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The certificate of your marriage with Oliva Corsinari, and the
        register of your child&rsquo;s birth.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The register of my child&rsquo;s birth?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The register of the birth of Andrea Cavalcanti&mdash;of your son;
        is not his name Andrea?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I believe so,&rdquo; said the major.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What? You believe so?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I dare not positively assert it, as he has been lost for so long a
        time.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo &ldquo;you have all the
        documents with you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your excellency, I regret to say that, not knowing it was necessary
        to come provided with these papers, I neglected to bring them.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is unfortunate,&rdquo; returned Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Were they, then, so necessary?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They were indispensable.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The major passed his hand across his brow. &ldquo;Ah, <i>perbacco</i>,
        indispensable, were they?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly they were; supposing there were to be doubts raised as to
        the validity of your marriage or the legitimacy of your child?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said the major, &ldquo;there might be doubts raised.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In that case your son would be very unpleasantly situated.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It would be fatal to his interests.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It might cause him to fail in some desirable matrimonial alliance.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>O peccato!</i>&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You must know that in France they are very particular on these
        points; it is not sufficient, as in Italy, to go to the priest and say,
        &lsquo;We love each other, and want you to marry us.&rsquo; Marriage is a
        civil affair in France, and in order to marry in an orthodox manner you
        must have papers which undeniably establish your identity.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is the misfortune! You see I have not these necessary papers.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Fortunately, I have them, though,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have them?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have them.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, indeed?&rdquo; said the major, who, seeing the object of his
        journey frustrated by the absence of the papers, feared also that his
        forgetfulness might give rise to some difficulty concerning the 48,000
        francs&mdash;&ldquo;ah, indeed, that is a fortunate circumstance; yes,
        that really is lucky, for it never occurred to me to bring them.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not at all wonder at it&mdash;one cannot think of everything;
        but, happily, the Abbé Busoni thought for you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is an excellent person.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is extremely prudent and thoughtful.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is an admirable man,&rdquo; said the major; &ldquo;and he sent
        them to you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Here they are.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The major clasped his hands in token of admiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You married Oliva Corsinari in the church of San Paolo del Monte-Cattini;
        here is the priest&rsquo;s certificate.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes indeed, there it is truly,&rdquo; said the Italian, looking on
        with astonishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And here is Andrea Cavalcanti&rsquo;s baptismal register, given by
        the curé of Saravezza.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;All quite correct.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Take these documents, then; they do not concern me. You will give
        them to your son, who will, of course, take great care of them.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I should think so, indeed! If he were to lose them&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and if he were to lose them?&rdquo; said Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; replied the major, &ldquo;it would be
        necessary to write to the curé for duplicates, and it would be some time
        before they could be obtained.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It would be a difficult matter to arrange,&rdquo; said Monte
        Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Almost an impossibility,&rdquo; replied the major.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am very glad to see that you understand the value of these
        papers.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I regard them as invaluable.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo &ldquo;as to the mother of the young
        man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As to the mother of the young man&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; repeated the
        Italian, with anxiety.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As regards the Marchesa Corsinari&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said the major, &ldquo;difficulties seem to thicken
        upon us; will she be wanted in any way?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo; &ldquo;besides, has she not&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said the major, &ldquo;she has&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30127m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Paid the last debt of nature?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas, yes,&rdquo; returned the Italian.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I knew that,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo; &ldquo;she has been dead
        these ten years.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And I am still mourning her loss,&rdquo; exclaimed the major,
        drawing from his pocket a checked handkerchief, and alternately wiping
        first the left and then the right eye.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What would you have?&rdquo; said Monte Cristo; &ldquo;we are all
        mortal. Now, you understand, my dear Monsieur Cavalcanti, that it is
        useless for you to tell people in France that you have been separated from
        your son for fifteen years. Stories of gypsies, who steal children, are
        not at all in vogue in this part of the world, and would not be believed.
        You sent him for his education to a college in one of the provinces, and
        now you wish him to complete his education in the Parisian world. That is
        the reason which has induced you to leave Via Reggio, where you have lived
        since the death of your wife. That will be sufficient.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You think so?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well, then.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If they should hear of the separation&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, yes; what could I say?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That an unfaithful tutor, bought over by the enemies of your family&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By the Corsinari?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Precisely. Had stolen away this child, in order that your name
        might become extinct.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is reasonable, since he is an only son.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, now that all is arranged, do not let these newly awakened
        remembrances be forgotten. You have, doubtless, already guessed that I was
        preparing a surprise for you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;An agreeable one?&rdquo; asked the Italian.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, I see the eye of a father is no more to be deceived than his
        heart.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; said the major.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Someone has told you the secret; or, perhaps, you guessed that he
        was here.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That who was here?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your child&mdash;your son&mdash;your Andrea!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I did guess it,&rdquo; replied the major with the greatest possible
        coolness. &ldquo;Then he is here?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo; &ldquo;when the valet de chambre
        came in just now, he told me of his arrival.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, very well, very well,&rdquo; said the major, clutching the
        buttons of his coat at each exclamation.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear sir,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, &ldquo;I understand your
        emotion; you must have time to recover yourself. I will, in the meantime,
        go and prepare the young man for this much-desired interview, for I
        presume that he is not less impatient for it than yourself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I should quite imagine that to be the case,&rdquo; said Cavalcanti.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, in a quarter of an hour he shall be with you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You will bring him, then? You carry your goodness so far as even to
        present him to me yourself?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; I do not wish to come between a father and son. Your interview
        will be private. But do not be uneasy; even if the powerful voice of
        nature should be silent, you cannot well mistake him; he will enter by
        this door. He is a fine young man, of fair complexion&mdash;a little too
        fair, perhaps&mdash;pleasing in manners; but you will see and judge for
        yourself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said the major, &ldquo;you know I have only the
        2,000 francs which the Abbé Busoni sent me; this sum I have expended upon
        travelling expenses, and&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you want money; that is a matter of course, my dear M.
        Cavalcanti. Well, here are 8,000 francs on account.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The major&rsquo;s eyes sparkled brilliantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is 40,000 francs which I now owe you,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Does your excellency wish for a receipt?&rdquo; said the major, at
        the same time slipping the money into the inner pocket of his coat.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;For what?&rdquo; said the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I thought you might want it to show the Abbé Busoni.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, when you receive the remaining 40,000, you shall give me a
        receipt in full. Between honest men such excessive precaution is, I think,
        quite unnecessary.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, so it is, between perfectly upright people.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;One word more,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Say on.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You will permit me to make one remark?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly; pray do so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then I should advise you to leave off wearing that style of dress.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said the major, regarding himself with an air of
        complete satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes. It may be worn at Via Reggio; but that costume, however
        elegant in itself, has long been out of fashion in Paris.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s unfortunate.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, if you really are attached to your old mode of dress; you can
        easily resume it when you leave Paris.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But what shall I wear?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What you find in your trunks.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In my trunks? I have but one portmanteau.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I dare say you have nothing else with you. What is the use of
        boring one&rsquo;s self with so many things? Besides an old soldier always
        likes to march with as little baggage as possible.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is just the case&mdash;precisely so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But you are a man of foresight and prudence, therefore you sent
        your luggage on before you. It has arrived at the Hôtel des Princes, Rue
        de Richelieu. It is there you are to take up your quarters.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then, in these trunks&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I presume you have given orders to your valet de chambre to put in
        all you are likely to need,&mdash;your plain clothes and your uniform. On
        grand occasions you must wear your uniform; that will look very well. Do
        not forget your crosses. They still laugh at them in France, and yet
        always wear them, for all that.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well, very well,&rdquo; said the major, who was in ecstasy at
        the attention paid him by the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, &ldquo;that you have fortified
        yourself against all painful excitement, prepare yourself, my dear M.
        Cavalcanti, to meet your lost Andrea.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Saying which Monte Cristo bowed, and disappeared behind the tapestry, leaving the
        major fascinated beyond expression with the delightful reception which he had
        received at the hands of the count.
