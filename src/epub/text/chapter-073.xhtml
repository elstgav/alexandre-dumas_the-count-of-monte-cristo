      <h2>Chapter 73. The Promise</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was indeed
        Maximilian Morrel, who had passed a wretched existence since the previous
        day. With the instinct peculiar to lovers he had anticipated after the
        return of Madame de Saint-Méran and the death of the marquis, that
        something would occur at M. de Villefort&rsquo;s in connection with his
        attachment for Valentine. His presentiments were realized, as we shall
        see, and his uneasy forebodings had goaded him pale and trembling to the
        gate under the chestnut-trees.
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine was ignorant of the cause of this sorrow and anxiety, and as it was not
        his accustomed hour for visiting her, she had gone to the spot simply by accident
        or perhaps through sympathy. Morrel called her, and she ran to the gate.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You here at this hour?&rdquo; said she.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, my poor girl,&rdquo; replied Morrel; &ldquo;I come to bring and to
        hear bad tidings.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This is, indeed, a house of mourning,&rdquo; said Valentine;
        &ldquo;speak, Maximilian, although the cup of sorrow seems already full.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Dear Valentine,&rdquo; said Morrel, endeavoring to conceal his own
        emotion, &ldquo;listen, I entreat you; what I am about to say is very
        serious. When are you to be married?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will tell you all,&rdquo; said Valentine; &ldquo;from you I have
        nothing to conceal. This morning the subject was introduced, and my dear
        grandmother, on whom I depended as my only support, not only declared
        herself favorable to it, but is so anxious for it, that they only await the arrival
        of M. d&rsquo;Épinay, and the following day the contract will be signed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        A deep sigh escaped the young man, who gazed long and mournfully at her he loved.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;it is dreadful thus to hear my condemnation
        from your own lips. The sentence is passed, and, in a few hours, will be executed;
        it must be so, and I will not endeavor to prevent it. But, since you say nothing
        remains but for M. d&rsquo;Épinay to arrive that the contract may be signed, and the
        following day you will be his, tomorrow you will be engaged to M. d&rsquo;Épinay,
        for he came this morning to Paris.&rdquo; Valentine uttered a cry.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I was at the house of Monte Cristo an hour since,&rdquo; said
        Morrel; &ldquo;we were speaking, he of the sorrow your family had
        experienced, and I of your grief, when a carriage rolled into the
        courtyard. Never, till then, had I placed any confidence in presentiments,
        but now I cannot help believing them, Valentine. At the sound of that
        carriage I shuddered; soon I heard steps on the staircase, which terrified
        me as much as the footsteps of the commander did Don Juan. The door at
        last opened; Albert de Morcerf entered first, and I began to hope my fears
        were vain, when, after him, another young man advanced, and the count
        exclaimed: &lsquo;Ah, here is the Baron Franz d&rsquo;Épinay!&rsquo;
        I summoned all my strength and courage to my support. Perhaps I turned
        pale and trembled, but certainly I smiled; and five minutes after I left,
        without having heard one word that had passed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Poor Maximilian!&rdquo; murmured Valentine.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Valentine, the time has arrived when you must answer me. And
        remember my life depends on your answer. What do you intend doing?&rdquo;
        Valentine held down her head; she was overwhelmed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Morrel; &ldquo;it is not the first time you
        have contemplated our present position, which is a serious and urgent one;
        I do not think it is a moment to give way to useless sorrow; leave that
        for those who like to suffer at their leisure and indulge their grief in
        secret. There are such in the world, and God will doubtless reward them in
        heaven for their resignation on earth, but those who mean to contend must
        not lose one precious moment, but must return immediately the blow which
        fortune strikes. Do you intend to struggle against our ill-fortune? Tell
        me, Valentine for it is that I came to know.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine trembled, and looked at him with amazement. The idea of
        resisting her father, her grandmother, and all the family, had never
        occurred to her.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you say, Maximilian?&rdquo; asked Valentine. &ldquo;What do you mean
        by a struggle? Oh, it would be a sacrilege. What? I resist my father&rsquo;s order,
        and my dying grandmother&rsquo;s wish? Impossible!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel started.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are too noble not to understand me, and you understand me so well that
        you already yield, dear Maximilian. No, no; I shall need all my strength to
        struggle with myself and support my grief in secret, as you say. But to
        grieve my father&mdash;to disturb my grandmother&rsquo;s last moments&mdash;never!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said Morrel, calmly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In what a tone you speak!&rdquo; cried Valentine.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I speak as one who admires you, mademoiselle.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; cried Valentine; &ldquo;mademoiselle! Oh,
        selfish man! he sees me in despair, and pretends he cannot understand me!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You mistake&mdash;I understand you perfectly. You will not oppose
        M. Villefort, you will not displease the marchioness, and tomorrow you
        will sign the contract which will bind you to your husband.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But, <i>mon Dieu!</i> tell me, how can I do otherwise?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do not appeal to me, mademoiselle; I shall be a bad judge in such a
        case; my selfishness will blind me,&rdquo; replied Morrel, whose low voice
        and clenched hands announced his growing desperation.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What would you have proposed, Maximilian, had you found me willing
        to accede?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is not for me to say.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are wrong; you must advise me what to do.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you seriously ask my advice, Valentine?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly, dear Maximilian, for if it is good, I will follow it;
        you know my devotion to you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Valentine,&rdquo; said Morrel pushing aside a loose plank, &ldquo;give
        me your hand in token of forgiveness of my anger; my senses are confused,
        and during the last hour the most extravagant thoughts have passed through
        my brain. Oh, if you refuse my advice&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you advise?&rdquo; said Valentine, raising her eyes to
        heaven and sighing.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am free,&rdquo; replied Maximilian, &ldquo;and rich enough to support you.
        I swear to make you my lawful wife before my lips even shall have approached your
        forehead.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You make me tremble!&rdquo; said the young girl.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; said Morrel; &ldquo;I will take you to my sister,
        who is worthy also to be yours. We will embark for Algiers, for England,
        for America, or, if you prefer it, retire to the country and only return
        to Paris when our friends have reconciled your family.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine shook her head.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I feared it, Maximilian,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;it is the counsel of a
        madman, and I should be more mad than you, did I not stop you at once with the
        word &lsquo;Impossible, Morrel, impossible!&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You will then submit to what fate decrees for you without even
        attempting to contend with it?&rdquo; said Morrel sorrowfully.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&mdash;if I die!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, Valentine,&rdquo; resumed Maximilian, &ldquo;I can only say
        again that you are right. Truly, it is I who am mad, and you prove to me
        that passion blinds the most well-meaning. I appreciate your calm
        reasoning. It is then understood that tomorrow you will be irrevocably
        promised to M. Franz d&rsquo;Épinay, not only by that theatrical formality
        invented to heighten the effect of a comedy called the signature of the
        contract, but your own will?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Again you drive me to despair, Maximilian,&rdquo; said Valentine,
        &ldquo;again you plunge the dagger into the wound! What would you do, tell
        me, if your sister listened to such a proposition?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; replied Morrel with a bitter smile, &ldquo;I
        am selfish&mdash;you have already said so&mdash;and as a selfish man I
        think not of what others would do in my situation, but of what I intend
        doing myself. I think only that I have known you not a whole year. From
        the day I first saw you, all my hopes of happiness have been in securing
        your affection. One day you acknowledged that you loved me, and since that
        day my hope of future happiness has rested on obtaining you, for to gain
        you would be life to me. Now, I think no more; I say only that fortune has
        turned against me&mdash;I had thought to gain heaven, and now I have lost
        it. It is an every-day occurrence for a gambler to lose not only what he
        possesses but also what he has not.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel pronounced these words with perfect calmness; Valentine looked at him a
        moment with her large, scrutinizing eyes, endeavoring not to let Morrel discover
        the grief which struggled in her heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But, in a word, what are you going to do?&rdquo; asked she.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am going to have the honor of taking my leave of you,
        mademoiselle, solemnly assuring you that I wish your life may be so calm,
        so happy, and so fully occupied, that there may be no place for me even in
        your memory.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured Valentine.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Adieu, Valentine, adieu!&rdquo; said Morrel, bowing.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; cried the young girl, extending her
        hand through the opening, and seizing Maximilian by his coat, for she
        understood from her own agitated feelings that her lover&rsquo;s calmness
        could not be real; &ldquo;where are you going?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am going, that I may not bring fresh trouble into your family:
        and to set an example which every honest and devoted man, situated as I
        am, may follow.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Before you leave me, tell me what you are going to do, Maximilian.&rdquo;
        The young man smiled sorrowfully.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Speak, speak!&rdquo; said Valentine; &ldquo;I entreat you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Has your resolution changed, Valentine?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It cannot change, unhappy man; you know it must not!&rdquo; cried
        the young girl.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then adieu, Valentine!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine shook the gate with a strength of which she could not have been supposed
        to be possessed, as Morrel was going away, and passing both her hands through
        the opening, she clasped and wrung them. &ldquo;I must know what you mean
        to do!&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, fear not,&rdquo; said Maximilian, stopping at a short distance,
        &ldquo;I do not intend to render another man responsible for the rigorous
        fate reserved for me. Another might threaten to seek M. Franz, to provoke
        him, and to fight with him; all that would be folly. What has M. Franz to
        do with it? He saw me this morning for the first time, and has already
        forgotten he has seen me. He did not even know I existed when it was
        arranged by your two families that you should be united. I have no enmity
        against M. Franz, and promise you the punishment shall not fall on him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On whom, then!&mdash;on me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On you? Valentine! Oh, Heaven forbid! Woman is sacred; the woman
        one loves is holy.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On yourself, then, unhappy man; on yourself?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am the only guilty person, am I not?&rdquo; said Maximilian.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Maximilian!&rdquo; said Valentine, &ldquo;Maximilian, come back, I
        entreat you!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He drew near with his sweet smile, and but for his paleness one might have thought
        him in his usual happy mood.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen, my dear, my adored Valentine,&rdquo; said he in his melodious and
        grave tone; &ldquo;those who, like us, have never had a thought for which we
        need blush before the world, such may read each other&rsquo;s hearts. I
        never was romantic, and am no melancholy hero. I imitate neither Manfred
        nor Anthony; but without words, protestations, or vows, my life has
        entwined itself with yours; you leave me, and you are right in doing so,&mdash;I
        repeat it, you are right; but in losing you, I lose my life. The moment you leave
        me, Valentine, I am alone in the world. My sister is happily married; her husband
        is only my brother-in-law, that is, a man whom the ties of social life alone attach
        to me; no one then longer needs my useless life. This is what I shall do; I will
        wait until the very moment you are married, for I will not lose the shadow of one
        of those unexpected chances which are sometimes reserved for us, since M. Franz
        may, after all, die before that time, a thunderbolt may fall even on the
        altar as you approach it,&mdash;nothing appears impossible to one
        condemned to die, and miracles appear quite reasonable when his escape
        from death is concerned. I will, then, wait until the last moment, and
        when my misery is certain, irremediable, hopeless, I will write a
        confidential letter to my brother-in-law, another to the prefect of
        police, to acquaint them with my intention, and at the corner of some
        wood, on the brink of some abyss, on the bank of some river, I will put an
        end to my existence, as certainly as I am the son of the most honest man
        who ever lived in France.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30333m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        Valentine trembled convulsively; she loosened her hold of the gate, her
        arms fell by her side, and two large tears rolled down her cheeks. The
        young man stood before her, sorrowful and resolute.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, for pity&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;you will live, will you
        not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, on my honor,&rdquo; said Maximilian; &ldquo;but that will not
        affect you. You have done your duty, and your conscience will be at rest.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine fell on her knees, and pressed her almost bursting heart.
        &ldquo;Maximilian,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;Maximilian, my friend, my
        brother on earth, my true husband in heaven, I entreat you, do as I do,
        live in suffering; perhaps we may one day be united.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Adieu, Valentine,&rdquo; repeated Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My God,&rdquo; said Valentine, raising both her hands to heaven
        with a sublime expression, &ldquo;I have done my utmost to remain a
        submissive daughter; I have begged, entreated, implored; he has regarded
        neither my prayers, my entreaties, nor my tears. It is done,&rdquo; cried
        she, wiping away her tears, and resuming her firmness, &ldquo;I am
        resolved not to die of remorse, but rather of shame. Live, Maximilian, and
        I will be yours. Say when shall it be? Speak, command, I will obey.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel, who had already gone some few steps away, again returned, and pale
        with joy extended both hands towards Valentine through the opening.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Valentine,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;dear Valentine, you must not
        speak thus&mdash;rather let me die. Why should I obtain you by violence,
        if our love is mutual? Is it from mere humanity you bid me live? I would
        then rather die.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Truly,&rdquo; murmured Valentine, &ldquo;who on this earth cares
        for me, if he does not? Who has consoled me in my sorrow but he? On whom
        do my hopes rest? On whom does my bleeding heart repose? On him, on him,
        always on him! Yes, you are right, Maximilian, I will follow you. I will
        leave the paternal home, I will give up all. Oh, ungrateful girl that I
        am,&rdquo; cried Valentine, sobbing, &ldquo;I will give up all, even my
        dear old grandfather, whom I had nearly forgotten.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Maximilian, &ldquo;you shall not leave him. M.
        Noirtier has evinced, you say, a kind feeling towards me. Well, before you
        leave, tell him all; his consent would be your justification in God&rsquo;s
        sight. As soon as we are married, he shall come and live with us, instead
        of one child, he shall have two. You have told me how you talk to him and
        how he answers you; I shall very soon learn that language by signs,
        Valentine, and I promise you solemnly, that instead of despair, it is
        happiness that awaits us.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, see, Maximilian, see the power you have over me, you almost
        make me believe you; and yet, what you tell me is madness, for my father
        will curse me&mdash;he is inflexible&mdash;he will never pardon me. Now
        listen to me, Maximilian; if by artifice, by entreaty, by accident&mdash;in
        short, if by any means I can delay this marriage, will you wait?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I promise you, as faithfully as you have promised me that this
        horrible marriage shall not take place, and that if you are dragged before
        a magistrate or a priest, you will refuse.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I promise you by all that is most sacred to me in the world,
        namely, by my mother.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We will wait, then,&rdquo; said Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, we will wait,&rdquo; replied Valentine, who revived at these
        words; &ldquo;there are so many things which may save unhappy beings such
        as we are.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I rely on you, Valentine,&rdquo; said Morrel; &ldquo;all you do
        will be well done; only if they disregard your prayers, if your father and
        Madame de Saint-Méran insist that M. d&rsquo;Épinay should be called
        tomorrow to sign the contract&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you have my promise, Maximilian.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Instead of signing&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will go to you, and we will fly; but from this moment until then,
        let us not tempt Providence, let us not see each other. It is a miracle,
        it is a providence that we have not been discovered. If we were surprised,
        if it were known that we met thus, we should have no further resource.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are right, Valentine; but how shall I ascertain?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;From the notary, M. Deschamps.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I know him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And for myself&mdash;I will write to you, depend on me. I dread
        this marriage, Maximilian, as much as you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you, my adored Valentine, thank you; that is enough. When
        once I know the hour, I will hasten to this spot, you can easily get over
        this fence with my assistance, a carriage will await us at the gate, in
        which you will accompany me to my sister&rsquo;s; there living, retired or
        mingling in society, as you wish, we shall be enabled to use our power to
        resist oppression, and not suffer ourselves to be put to death like sheep,
        which only defend themselves by sighs.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Valentine, &ldquo;I will now acknowledge you are
        right, Maximilian; and now are you satisfied with your betrothal?&rdquo;
        said the young girl sorrowfully.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My adored Valentine, words cannot express one half of my
        satisfaction.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine had approached, or rather, had placed her lips so near the fence, that
        they nearly touched those of Morrel, which were pressed against the other side of
        the cold and inexorable barrier.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Adieu, then, till we meet again,&rdquo; said Valentine, tearing herself
        away. &ldquo;I shall hear from you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thanks, thanks, dear love, adieu!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The sound of a kiss was heard, and Valentine fled through the avenue. Morrel
        listened to catch the last sound of her dress brushing the branches, and of her
        footstep on the gravel, then raised his eyes with an ineffable smile of
        thankfulness to heaven for being permitted to be thus loved, and then also
        disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        The young man returned home and waited all the evening and all the
        next day without getting any message. It was only on the following day, at
        about ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, as he was starting to call on M.
        Deschamps, the notary, that he received from the postman a small billet,
        which he knew to be from Valentine, although he had not before seen her
        writing. It was to this effect:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Tears, entreaties, prayers, have availed me nothing. Yesterday, for
        two hours, I was at the church of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule, and for two
        hours I prayed most fervently. Heaven is as inflexible as man, and the
        signature of the contract is fixed for this evening at nine o&rsquo;clock.
        I have but one promise and but one heart to give; that promise is pledged
        to you, that heart is also yours. This evening, then, at a quarter to nine
        at the gate.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your betrothed,
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Valentine de Villefort.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;P.S.&mdash;My poor grandmother gets worse and worse; yesterday her
        fever amounted to delirium; today her delirium is almost madness. You will
        be very kind to me, will you not, Morrel, to make me forget my sorrow in
        leaving her thus? I think it is kept a secret from grandpapa Noirtier,
        that the contract is to be signed this evening.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel went also to the notary, who confirmed the news that the contract
        was to be signed that evening. Then he went to call on Monte Cristo and
        heard still more. Franz had been to announce the ceremony, and Madame de
        Villefort had also written to beg the count to excuse her not inviting
        him; the death of M. de Saint-Méran and the dangerous illness of his widow
        would cast a gloom over the meeting which she would regret should be
        shared by the count whom she wished every happiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The day before Franz had been presented to Madame de Saint-Méran, who had left her
        bed to receive him, but had been obliged to return to it immediately after.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is easy to suppose that Morrel&rsquo;s agitation would not escape the
        count&rsquo;s penetrating eye. Monte Cristo was more affectionate than
        ever,&mdash;indeed, his manner was so kind that several times Morrel was on the
        point of telling him all. But he recalled the promise he had made to Valentine, and
        kept his secret.
      </p>
      <p>
        The young man read Valentine&rsquo;s letter twenty times in the course of
        the day. It was her first, and on what an occasion! Each time he read it
        he renewed his vow to make her happy. How great is the power of a woman
        who has made so courageous a resolution! What devotion does she deserve
        from him for whom she has sacrificed everything! How ought she really to
        be supremely loved! She becomes at once a queen and a wife, and it is
        impossible to thank and love her sufficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel longed intensely for the moment when he should hear Valentine say,
        &ldquo;Here I am, Maximilian; come and help me.&rdquo; He had arranged everything
        for her escape; two ladders were hidden in the clover-field; a cabriolet was
        ordered for Maximilian alone, without a servant, without lights; at the
        turning of the first street they would light the lamps, as it would be
        foolish to attract the notice of the police by too many precautions.
        Occasionally he shuddered; he thought of the moment when, from the top of
        that wall, he should protect the descent of his dear Valentine, pressing
        in his arms for the first time her of whom he had yet only kissed the
        delicate hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the afternoon arrived and he felt that the hour was drawing near, he
        wished for solitude, his agitation was extreme; a simple question from a
        friend would have irritated him. He shut himself in his room, and tried to
        read, but his eye glanced over the page without understanding a word, and
        he threw away the book, and for the second time sat down to sketch his
        plan, the ladders and the fence.
      </p>
      <p>
        At length the hour drew near. Never did a man deeply in love allow the
        clocks to go on peacefully. Morrel tormented his so effectually that they
        struck eight at half-past six. He then said, &ldquo;It is time to start;
        the signature was indeed fixed to take place at nine o&rsquo;clock, but
        perhaps Valentine will not wait for that.&rdquo; Consequently, Morrel,
        having left the Rue Meslay at half-past eight by his timepiece, entered
        the clover-field while the clock of Saint-Philippe-du-Roule was striking
        eight. The horse and cabriolet were concealed behind a small ruin, where
        Morrel had often waited.
      </p>
      <p>
        The night gradually drew on, and the foliage in the garden assumed a
        deeper hue. Then Morrel came out from his hiding-place with a beating
        heart, and looked through the small opening in the gate; there was yet no
        one to be seen.
      </p>
      <p>
        The clock struck half-past eight, and still another half-hour was passed
        in waiting, while Morrel walked to and fro, and gazed more and more
        frequently through the opening. The garden became darker still, but in the
        darkness he looked in vain for the white dress, and in the silence he
        vainly listened for the sound of footsteps. The house, which was
        discernible through the trees, remained in darkness, and gave no
        indication that so important an event as the signature of a
        marriage-contract was going on. Morrel looked at his watch, which wanted a
        quarter to ten; but soon the same clock he had already heard strike two or
        three times rectified the error by striking half-past nine.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was already half an hour past the time Valentine had fixed. It was a
        terrible moment for the young man. The slightest rustling of the foliage,
        the least whistling of the wind, attracted his attention, and drew the
        perspiration to his brow; then he tremblingly fixed his ladder, and, not
        to lose a moment, placed his foot on the first step. Amidst all these
        alternations of hope and fear, the clock struck ten. &ldquo;It is
        impossible,&rdquo; said Maximilian, &ldquo;that the signing of a contract
        should occupy so long a time without unexpected interruptions. I have
        weighed all the chances, calculated the time required for all the forms;
        something must have happened.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And then he walked rapidly to and fro, and pressed his burning forehead against the
        fence. Had Valentine fainted? or had she been discovered and stopped in her flight?
        These were the only obstacles which appeared possible to the young man.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea that her strength had failed her in attempting to escape, and
        that she had fainted in one of the paths, was the one that most impressed
        itself upon his mind. &ldquo;In that case,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I should
        lose her, and by my own fault.&rdquo; He dwelt on this idea for a moment,
        then it appeared reality. He even thought he could perceive something on
        the ground at a distance; he ventured to call, and it seemed to him that
        the wind wafted back an almost inarticulate sigh.
      </p>
      <p>
        At last the half-hour struck. It was impossible to wait longer, his
        temples throbbed violently, his eyes were growing dim; he passed one leg
        over the wall, and in a moment leaped down on the other side. He was on
        Villefort&rsquo;s premises&mdash;had arrived there by scaling the wall.
        What might be the consequences? However, he had not ventured thus far to
        draw back. He followed a short distance close under the wall, then crossed
        a path, hid entered a clump of trees. In a moment he had passed through
        them, and could see the house distinctly.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30341m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        Then Morrel saw that he had been right in believing that the house was not
        illuminated. Instead of lights at every window, as is customary on days of
        ceremony, he saw only a gray mass, which was veiled also by a cloud, which
        at that moment obscured the moon&rsquo;s feeble light. A light moved
        rapidly from time to time past three windows of the second floor. These
        three windows were in Madame de Saint-Méran&rsquo;s room. Another remained
        motionless behind some red curtains which were in Madame de Villefort&rsquo;s
        bedroom. Morrel guessed all this. So many times, in order to follow
        Valentine in thought at every hour in the day, had he made her describe
        the whole house, that without having seen it he knew it all.
      </p>
      <p>
        This darkness and silence alarmed Morrel still more than Valentine&rsquo;s
        absence had done. Almost mad with grief, and determined to venture
        everything in order to see Valentine once more, and be certain of the
        misfortune he feared, Morrel gained the edge of the clump of trees, and
        was going to pass as quickly as possible through the flower-garden, when
        the sound of a voice, still at some distance, but which was borne upon the
        wind, reached him. At this sound, as he was already partially exposed to
        view, he stepped back and concealed himself completely, remaining
        perfectly motionless.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had formed his resolution. If it was Valentine alone, he would speak as
        she passed; if she was accompanied, and he could not speak, still he
        should see her, and know that she was safe; if they were strangers, he
        would listen to their conversation, and might understand something of this
        hitherto incomprehensible mystery.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moon had just then escaped from behind the cloud which had concealed it, and
        Morrel saw Villefort come out upon the steps, followed by a gentleman in black.
        They descended, and advanced towards the clump of trees, and Morrel soon
        recognized the other gentleman as Doctor d&rsquo;Avrigny.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30339m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        The young man, seeing them approach, drew back mechanically, until he
        found himself stopped by a sycamore-tree in the centre of the clump; there
        he was compelled to remain. Soon the two gentlemen stopped also.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, my dear doctor,&rdquo; said the procureur, &ldquo;Heaven
        declares itself against my house! What a dreadful death&mdash;what a blow!
        Seek not to console me; alas, nothing can alleviate so great a sorrow&mdash;the
        wound is too deep and too fresh! Dead, dead!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The cold sweat sprang to the young man&rsquo;s brow, and his teeth chattered. Who
        could be dead in that house, which Villefort himself had called accursed?
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear M. de Villefort,&rdquo; replied the doctor, with a tone which
        redoubled the terror of the young man, &ldquo;I have not led you here to console
        you; on the contrary&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What can you mean?&rdquo; asked the procureur, alarmed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I mean that behind the misfortune which has just happened to you,
        there is another, perhaps, still greater.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Can it be possible?&rdquo; murmured Villefort, clasping his hands.
        &ldquo;What are you going to tell me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are we quite alone, my friend?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, quite; but why all these precautions?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because I have a terrible secret to communicate to you,&rdquo; said
        the doctor. &ldquo;Let us sit down.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort fell, rather than seated himself. The doctor stood before him,
        with one hand placed on his shoulder. Morrel, horrified, supported his
        head with one hand, and with the other pressed his heart, lest its
        beatings should be heard. &ldquo;Dead, dead!&rdquo; repeated he within
        himself; and he felt as if he were also dying.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Speak, doctor&mdash;I am listening,&rdquo; said Villefort; &ldquo;strike&mdash;I
        am prepared for everything!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Madame de Saint-Méran was, doubtless, advancing in years, but she
        enjoyed excellent health.&rdquo; Morrel began again to breathe freely,
        which he had not done during the last ten minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Grief has consumed her,&rdquo; said Villefort&mdash;&ldquo;yes,
        grief, doctor! After living forty years with the marquis&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is not grief, my dear Villefort,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;grief
        may kill, although it rarely does, and never in a day, never in an hour,
        never in ten minutes.&rdquo; Villefort answered nothing, he simply raised
        his head, which had been cast down before, and looked at the doctor with
        amazement.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Were you present during the last struggle?&rdquo; asked M. d&rsquo;Avrigny.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I was,&rdquo; replied the procureur; &ldquo;you begged me not to
        leave.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you notice the symptoms of the disease to which Madame de
        Saint-Méran has fallen a victim?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I did. Madame de Saint-Méran had three successive attacks, at
        intervals of some minutes, each one more serious than the former. When you
        arrived, Madame de Saint-Méran had already been panting for breath some
        minutes; she then had a fit, which I took to be simply a nervous attack,
        and it was only when I saw her raise herself in the bed, and her limbs and
        neck appear stiffened, that I became really alarmed. Then I understood
        from your countenance there was more to fear than I had thought. This
        crisis past, I endeavored to catch your eye, but could not. You held her
        hand&mdash;you were feeling her pulse&mdash;and the second fit came on
        before you had turned towards me. This was more terrible than the first;
        the same nervous movements were repeated, and the mouth contracted and
        turned purple.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And at the third she expired.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At the end of the first attack I discovered symptoms of tetanus;
        you confirmed my opinion.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, before others,&rdquo; replied the doctor; &ldquo;but now we
        are alone&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What are you going to say? Oh, spare me!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances
        are the same.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        M. de Villefort started from his seat, then in a moment fell down again, silent
        and motionless. Morrel knew not if he were dreaming or awake.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;I know the full importance of the
        statement I have just made, and the disposition of the man to whom I have made
        it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you speak to me as a magistrate or as a friend?&rdquo; asked
        Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As a friend, and only as a friend, at this moment. The similarity
        in the symptoms of tetanus and poisoning by vegetable substances is so
        great, that were I obliged to affirm by oath what I have now stated, I
        should hesitate; I therefore repeat to you, I speak not to a magistrate,
        but to a friend. And to that friend I say, &lsquo;During the
        three-quarters of an hour that the struggle continued, I watched the
        convulsions and the death of Madame de Saint-Méran, and am thoroughly
        convinced that not only did her death proceed from poison, but I could
        also specify the poison.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Can it be possible?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The symptoms are marked, do you see?&mdash;sleep broken by nervous
        spasms, excitation of the brain, torpor of the nerve centres. Madame de
        Saint-Méran succumbed to a powerful dose of brucine or of strychnine,
        which by some mistake, perhaps, has been given to her.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort seized the doctor&rsquo;s hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, it is impossible,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I must be dreaming! It is
        frightful to hear such things from such a man as you! Tell me, I entreat you, my
        dear doctor, that you may be deceived.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Doubtless I may, but&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30345m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But I do not think so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have pity on me doctor! So many dreadful things have happened to me
        lately that I am on the verge of madness.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Has anyone besides me seen Madame de Saint-Méran?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Has anything been sent for from a chemist&rsquo;s that I have not
        examined?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Had Madame de Saint-Méran any enemies?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not to my knowledge.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Would her death affect anyone&rsquo;s interest?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It could not indeed, my daughter is her only heiress&mdash;Valentine
        alone. Oh, if such a thought could present itself, I would stab myself to
        punish my heart for having for one instant harbored it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed, my dear friend,&rdquo; said M. d&rsquo;Avrigny, &ldquo;I
        would not accuse anyone; I speak only of an accident, you understand,&mdash;of
        a mistake,&mdash;but whether accident or mistake, the fact is there; it is
        on my conscience and compels me to speak aloud to you. Make inquiry.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of whom?&mdash;how?&mdash;of what?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;May not Barrois, the old servant, have made a mistake, and have
        given Madame de Saint-Méran a dose prepared for his master?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;For my father?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But how could a dose prepared for M. Noirtier poison Madame de
        Saint-Méran?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing is more simple. You know poisons become remedies in certain
        diseases, of which paralysis is one. For instance, having tried every
        other remedy to restore movement and speech to M. Noirtier, I resolved to
        try one last means, and for three months I have been giving him brucine;
        so that in the last dose I ordered for him there were six grains. This
        quantity, which is perfectly safe to administer to the paralyzed frame of
        M. Noirtier, which has become gradually accustomed to it, would be
        sufficient to kill another person.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear doctor, there is no communication between M. Noirtier&rsquo;s
        apartment and that of Madame de Saint-Méran, and Barrois never entered my
        mother-in-law&rsquo;s room. In short, doctor although I know you to be the
        most conscientious man in the world, and although I place the utmost
        reliance in you, I want, notwithstanding my conviction, to believe this
        axiom, <i>errare humanum est</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is there one of my brethren in whom you have equal confidence with
        myself?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why do you ask me that?&mdash;what do you wish?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Send for him; I will tell him what I have seen, and we will consult
        together, and examine the body.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you will find traces of poison?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I did not say of poison, but we can prove what was the state of
        the body; we shall discover the cause of her sudden death, and we shall
        say, &lsquo;Dear Villefort, if this thing has been caused by negligence,
        watch over your servants; if from hatred, watch your enemies.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you propose to me, d&rsquo;Avrigny?&rdquo; said Villefort
        in despair; &ldquo;so soon as another is admitted into our secret, an
        inquest will become necessary; and an inquest in my house&mdash;impossible!
        Still,&rdquo; continued the procureur, looking at the doctor with
        uneasiness, &ldquo;if you wish it&mdash;if you demand it, why then it
        shall be done. But, doctor, you see me already so grieved&mdash;how can I
        introduce into my house so much scandal, after so much sorrow? My wife and
        my daughter would die of it! And I, doctor&mdash;you know a man does not
        arrive at the post I occupy&mdash;one has not been king&rsquo;s attorney
        twenty-five years without having amassed a tolerable number of enemies;
        mine are numerous. Let this affair be talked of, it will be a triumph for
        them, which will make them rejoice, and cover me with shame. Pardon me,
        doctor, these worldly ideas; were you a priest I should not dare tell you
        that, but you are a man, and you know mankind. Doctor, pray recall your
        words; you have said nothing, have you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear M. de Villefort,&rdquo; replied the doctor, &ldquo;my first
        duty is to humanity. I would have saved Madame de Saint-Méran, if science
        could have done it; but she is dead and my duty regards the living. Let us
        bury this terrible secret in the deepest recesses of our hearts; I am
        willing, if anyone should suspect this, that my silence on the subject
        should be imputed to my ignorance. Meanwhile, sir, watch always&mdash;watch
        carefully, for perhaps the evil may not stop here. And when you have found
        the culprit, if you find him, I will say to you, &lsquo;You are a
        magistrate, do as you will!&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I thank you, doctor,&rdquo; said Villefort with indescribable joy;
        &ldquo;I never had a better friend than you.&rdquo; And, as if he feared
        Doctor d&rsquo;Avrigny would recall his promise, he hurried him towards
        the house.
      </p>
      <p>
        When they were gone, Morrel ventured out from under the trees, and the
        moon shone upon his face, which was so pale it might have been taken for
        that of a ghost.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am manifestly protected in a most wonderful, but most terrible
        manner,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but Valentine, poor girl, how will she bear so
        much sorrow?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        As he thought thus, he looked alternately at the window with red curtains
        and the three windows with white curtains. The light had almost
        disappeared from the former; doubtless Madame de Villefort had just put
        out her lamp, and the nightlamp alone reflected its dull light on the
        window. At the extremity of the building, on the contrary, he saw one of
        the three windows open. A wax-light placed on the mantle-piece threw some
        of its pale rays without, and a shadow was seen for one moment on the
        balcony. Morrel shuddered; he thought he heard a sob.
      </p>
      <p>
        It cannot be wondered at that his mind, generally so courageous, but now
        disturbed by the two strongest human passions, love and fear, was weakened
        even to the indulgence of superstitious thoughts. Although it was
        impossible that Valentine should see him, hidden as he was, he thought he
        heard the shadow at the window call him; his disturbed mind told him so.
        This double error became an irresistible reality, and by one of the
        incomprehensible transports of youth, he bounded from his hiding-place,
        and with two strides, at the risk of being seen, at the risk of alarming
        Valentine, at the risk of being discovered by some exclamation which might
        escape the young girl, he crossed the flower-garden, which by the light of
        the moon resembled a large white lake, and having passed the rows of
        orange-trees which extended in front of the house, he reached the step,
        ran quickly up and pushed the door, which opened without offering any resistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine had not seen him. Her eyes, raised towards heaven, were watching a
        silvery cloud gliding over the azure, its form that of a shadow mounting towards
        heaven. Her poetic and excited mind pictured it as the soul of her grandmother.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, Morrel had traversed the anteroom and found the staircase,
        which, being carpeted, prevented his approach being heard, and he had
        regained that degree of confidence that the presence of M. de Villefort
        even would not have alarmed him. He was quite prepared for any such
        encounter. He would at once approach Valentine&rsquo;s father and
        acknowledge all, begging Villefort to pardon and sanction the love which
        united two fond and loving hearts. Morrel was mad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Happily he did not meet anyone. Now, especially, did he find the
        description Valentine had given of the interior of the house useful to
        him; he arrived safely at the top of the staircase, and while he was
        feeling his way, a sob indicated the direction he was to take. He turned
        back, a door partly open enabled him to see his road, and to hear the
        voice of one in sorrow. He pushed the door open and entered. At the other
        end of the room, under a white sheet which covered it, lay the corpse,
        still more alarming to Morrel since the account he had so unexpectedly
        overheard. By its side, on her knees, and with her head buried in the
        cushion of an easy-chair, was Valentine, trembling and sobbing, her hands
        extended above her head, clasped and stiff. She had turned from the
        window, which remained open, and was praying in accents that would have
        affected the most unfeeling; her words were rapid, incoherent,
        unintelligible, for the burning weight of grief almost stopped her
        utterance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The moon shining through the open blinds made the lamp appear to burn
        paler, and cast a sepulchral hue over the whole scene. Morrel could not
        resist this; he was not exemplary for piety, he was not easily impressed,
        but Valentine suffering, weeping, wringing her hands before him, was more
        than he could bear in silence. He sighed, and whispered a name, and the
        head bathed in tears and pressed on the velvet cushion of the chair&mdash;a
        head like that of a Magdalen by Correggio&mdash;was raised and turned
        towards him. Valentine perceived him without betraying the least surprise.
        A heart overwhelmed with one great grief is insensible to minor emotions.
        Morrel held out his hand to her. Valentine, as her only apology for not
        having met him, pointed to the corpse under the sheet, and began to sob
        again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither dared for some time to speak in that room. They hesitated to break
        the silence which death seemed to impose; at length Valentine ventured.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;how came you here? Alas, I would
        say you are welcome, had not death opened the way for you into this house.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Valentine,&rdquo; said Morrel with a trembling voice, &ldquo;I had
        waited since half-past eight, and did not see you come; I became uneasy,
        leaped the wall, found my way through the garden, when voices conversing
        about the fatal event&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What voices?&rdquo; asked Valentine. Morrel shuddered as he thought
        of the conversation of the doctor and M. de Villefort, and he thought he
        could see through the sheet the extended hands, the stiff neck, and the
        purple lips.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your servants,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;who were repeating the whole
        of the sorrowful story; from them I learned it all.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But it was risking the failure of our plan to come up here, love.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; replied Morrel; &ldquo;I will go away.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Valentine, &ldquo;you might meet someone; stay.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But if anyone should come here&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The young girl shook her head. &ldquo;No one will come,&rdquo; said she;
        &ldquo;do not fear, there is our safeguard,&rdquo; pointing to the bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But what has become of M. d&rsquo;Épinay?&rdquo; replied Morrel.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30349m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. Franz arrived to sign the contract just as my dear grandmother
        was dying.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; said Morrel with a feeling of selfish joy; for he
        thought this death would cause the wedding to be postponed indefinitely.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But what redoubles my sorrow,&rdquo; continued the young girl, as
        if this feeling was to receive its immediate punishment, &ldquo;is that
        the poor old lady, on her death-bed, requested that the marriage might
        take place as soon as possible; she also, thinking to protect me, was
        acting against me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; said Morrel. They both listened; steps were distinctly
        heard in the corridor and on the stairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is my father, who has just left his study.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To accompany the doctor to the door,&rdquo; added Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How do you know it is the doctor?&rdquo; asked Valentine,
        astonished.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I imagined it must be,&rdquo; said Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine looked at the young man; they heard the street door close, then M. de
        Villefort locked the garden door, and returned upstairs. He stopped a moment in
        the anteroom, as if hesitating whether to turn to his own apartment or into
        Madame de Saint-Méran&rsquo;s; Morrel concealed himself behind a door;
        Valentine remained motionless, grief seeming to deprive her of all fear.
        M. de Villefort passed on to his own room.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Valentine, &ldquo;you can neither go out by the front door
        nor by the garden.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel looked at her with astonishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There is but one way left you that is safe,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;it is
        through my grandfather&rsquo;s room.&rdquo; She rose. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; she added.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where?&rdquo; asked Maximilian.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To my grandfather&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I in M. Noirtier&rsquo;s apartment?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Can you mean it, Valentine?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have long wished it; he is my only remaining friend and we both
        need his help,&mdash;come.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Be careful, Valentine,&rdquo; said Morrel, hesitating to comply
        with the young girl&rsquo;s wishes; &ldquo;I now see my error&mdash;I
        acted like a madman in coming in here. Are you sure you are more
        reasonable?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Valentine; &ldquo;and I have but one scruple,&mdash;that
        of leaving my dear grandmother&rsquo;s remains, which I had undertaken to
        watch.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Valentine,&rdquo; said Morrel, &ldquo;death is in itself sacred.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Valentine; &ldquo;besides, it will not be for
        long.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        She then crossed the corridor, and led the way down a narrow staircase to M.
        Noirtier&rsquo;s room; Morrel followed her on tiptoe; at the door they found
        the old servant.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Barrois,&rdquo; said Valentine, &ldquo;shut the door, and let no one come
        in.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        She passed first.
      </p>
      <p>
        Noirtier, seated in his chair, and listening to every sound, was watching the door;
        he saw Valentine, and his eye brightened. There was something grave and solemn in
        the approach of the young girl which struck the old man, and immediately his bright
        eye began to interrogate.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Dear grandfather.&rdquo; said she hurriedly, &ldquo;you know poor grandmamma
        died an hour since, and now I have no friend in the world but you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        His expressive eyes evinced the greatest tenderness.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To you alone, then, may I confide my sorrows and my hopes?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The paralytic motioned &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine took Maximilian&rsquo;s hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Look attentively, then, at this gentleman.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The old man fixed his scrutinizing gaze with slight astonishment on Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is M. Maximilian Morrel,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;the son of that good
        merchant of Marseilles, whom you doubtless recollect.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the old man.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He brings an irreproachable name, which Maximilian is likely to render
        glorious, since at thirty years of age he is a captain, an officer of the Legion
        of Honor.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The old man signified that he recollected him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, grandpapa,&rdquo; said Valentine, kneeling before him, and pointing
        to Maximilian, &ldquo;I love him, and will be only his; were I compelled to marry
        another, I would destroy myself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The eyes of the paralytic expressed a multitude of tumultuous thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You like M. Maximilian Morrel, do you not, grandpapa?&rdquo; asked Valentine.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you will protect us, who are your children, against the will of
        my father?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Noirtier cast an intelligent glance at Morrel, as if to say, &ldquo;perhaps I
        may.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Maximilian understood him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you have a sacred duty to
        fulfil in your deceased grandmother&rsquo;s room, will you allow me the
        honor of a few minutes&rsquo; conversation with M. Noirtier?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is it,&rdquo; said the old man&rsquo;s eye. Then he looked
        anxiously at Valentine.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you fear he will not understand?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, we have so often spoken of you, that he knows exactly how I
        talk to you.&rdquo; Then turning to Maximilian, with an adorable smile;
        although shaded by sorrow,&mdash;&ldquo;He knows everything I know,&rdquo;
        said she.
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine arose, placed a chair for Morrel, requested Barrois not to admit
        anyone, and having tenderly embraced her grandfather, and sorrowfully
        taken leave of Morrel, she went away. To prove to Noirtier that he was in
        Valentine&rsquo;s confidence and knew all their secrets, Morrel took the
        dictionary, a pen, and some paper, and placed them all on a table where
        there was a light.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But first,&rdquo; said Morrel, &ldquo;allow me, sir, to tell you
        who I am, how much I love Mademoiselle Valentine, and what are my designs
        respecting her.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Noirtier made a sign that he would listen.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was an imposing sight to witness this old man, apparently a mere
        useless burden, becoming the sole protector, support, and adviser of the
        lovers who were both young, beautiful, and strong. His remarkably noble
        and austere expression struck Morrel, who began his story with trembling.
        He related the manner in which he had become acquainted with Valentine,
        and how he had loved her, and that Valentine, in her solitude and her
        misfortune, had accepted the offer of his devotion. He told him his birth,
        his position, his fortune, and more than once, when he consulted the look
        of the paralytic, that look answered, &ldquo;That is good, proceed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Morrel, when he had finished the first part of
        his recital, &ldquo;now I have told you of my love and my hopes, may I
        inform you of my intentions?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; signified the old man.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This was our resolution; a cabriolet was in waiting at the gate, in
        which I intended to carry off Valentine to my sister&rsquo;s house, to
        marry her, and to wait respectfully M. de Villefort&rsquo;s pardon.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Noirtier.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We must not do so?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You do not sanction our project?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There is another way,&rdquo; said Morrel. The old man&rsquo;s
        interrogative eye said, &ldquo;Which?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will go,&rdquo; continued Maximilian, &ldquo;I will seek M. Franz
        d&rsquo;Épinay&mdash;I am happy to be able to mention this in Mademoiselle
        de Villefort&rsquo;s absence&mdash;and will conduct myself toward him so
        as to compel him to challenge me.&rdquo; Noirtier&rsquo;s look continued
        to interrogate.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You wish to know what I will do?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will find him, as I told you. I will tell him the ties which bind
        me to Mademoiselle Valentine; if he be a sensible man, he will prove it by
        renouncing of his own accord the hand of his betrothed, and will secure my
        friendship, and love until death; if he refuse, either through interest or
        ridiculous pride, after I have proved to him that he would be forcing my
        wife from me, that Valentine loves me, and will have no other, I will
        fight with him, give him every advantage, and I shall kill him, or he will
        kill me; if I am victorious, he will not marry Valentine, and if I die, I
        am very sure Valentine will not marry him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Noirtier watched, with indescribable pleasure, this noble and sincere countenance,
        on which every sentiment his tongue uttered was depicted, adding by the expression
        of his fine features all that coloring adds to a sound and faithful drawing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, when Morrel had finished, he shut his eyes several times, which was
        his manner of saying &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No?&rdquo; said Morrel; &ldquo;you disapprove of this second
        project, as you did of the first?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do,&rdquo; signified the old man.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But what then must be done?&rdquo; asked Morrel. &ldquo;Madame de
        Saint-Méran&rsquo;s last request was, that the marriage might not be
        delayed; must I let things take their course?&rdquo; Noirtier did not
        move. &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Morrel; &ldquo;I am to wait.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But delay may ruin our plan, sir,&rdquo; replied the young man.
        &ldquo;Alone, Valentine has no power; she will be compelled to submit. I
        am here almost miraculously, and can scarcely hope for so good an
        opportunity to occur again. Believe me, there are only the two plans I
        have proposed to you; forgive my vanity, and tell me which you prefer. Do
        you authorize Mademoiselle Valentine to intrust herself to my honor?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you prefer I should seek M. d&rsquo;Épinay?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Whence then will come the help we need&mdash;from chance?&rdquo;
        resumed Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;From you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You thoroughly understand me, sir? Pardon my eagerness, for my life
        depends on your answer. Will our help come from you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are sure of it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; There was so much firmness in the look which gave this
        answer, no one could, at any rate, doubt his will, if they did his power.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, thank you a thousand times! But how, unless a miracle should
        restore your speech, your gesture, your movement, how can you, chained to
        that armchair, dumb and motionless, oppose this marriage?&rdquo; A smile
        lit up the old man&rsquo;s face, a strange smile of the eyes in a paralyzed face.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then I must wait?&rdquo; asked the young man.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But the contract?&rdquo; The same smile returned. &ldquo;Will you
        assure me it shall not be signed?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Noirtier.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The contract shall not be signed!&rdquo; cried Morrel. &ldquo;Oh,
        pardon me, sir; I can scarcely realize so great a happiness. Will they not
        sign it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the paralytic. Notwithstanding that assurance,
        Morrel still hesitated. This promise of an impotent old man was so strange
        that, instead of being the result of the power of his will, it might
        emanate from enfeebled organs. Is it not natural that the madman, ignorant
        of his folly, should attempt things beyond his power? The weak man talks
        of burdens he can raise, the timid of giants he can confront, the poor of
        treasures he spends, the most humble peasant, in the height of his pride,
        calls himself Jupiter. Whether Noirtier understood the young man&rsquo;s
        indecision, or whether he had not full confidence in his docility, he
        looked uneasily at him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you wish, sir?&rdquo; asked Morrel; &ldquo;that I should renew my
        promise of remaining tranquil?&rdquo; Noirtier&rsquo;s eye remained fixed and firm,
        as if to imply that a promise did not suffice; then it passed from his face to his
        hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall I swear to you, sir?&rdquo; asked Maximilian.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the paralytic with the same solemnity. Morrel
        understood that the old man attached great importance to an oath. He
        extended his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I swear to you, on my honor,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to await your
        decision respecting the course I am to pursue with M. d&rsquo;Épinay.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; said the old man.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Morrel, &ldquo;do you wish me to retire?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Without seeing Mademoiselle Valentine?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel made a sign that he was ready to obey. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said he,
        &ldquo;first allow me to embrace you as your daughter did just now.&rdquo;
        Noirtier&rsquo;s expression could not be understood. The young man pressed
        his lips on the same spot, on the old man&rsquo;s forehead, where
        Valentine&rsquo;s had been. Then he bowed a second time and retired.
      </p>
      <p>
        He found outside the door the old servant, to whom Valentine had given
        directions. Morrel was conducted along a dark passage, which led to a
        little door opening on the garden, soon found the spot where he had
        entered, with the assistance of the shrubs gained the top of the wall, and
        by his ladder was in an instant in the clover-field where his cabriolet
        was still waiting for him. He got in it, and thoroughly wearied by so many
        emotions, arrived about midnight in the Rue Meslay, threw himself on his
        bed and slept soundly.
