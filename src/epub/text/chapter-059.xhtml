      <h2>Chapter 59. The Will</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s soon as Barrois
        had left the room, Noirtier looked at Valentine with a malicious
        expression that said many things. The young girl perfectly understood the
        look, and so did Villefort, for his countenance became clouded, and he
        knitted his eyebrows angrily. He took a seat, and quietly awaited the
        arrival of the notary. Noirtier saw him seat himself with an appearance of
        perfect indifference, at the same time giving a side look at Valentine,
        which made her understand that she also was to remain in the room.
        Three-quarters of an hour after, Barrois returned, bringing the notary with him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Villefort, after the first salutations were over,
        &ldquo;you were sent for by M. Noirtier, whom you see here. All his limbs have
        become completely paralysed, he has lost his voice also, and we ourselves find
        much trouble in endeavoring to catch some fragments of his meaning.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Noirtier cast an appealing look on Valentine, which look was at once so earnest
        and imperative, that she answered immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I perfectly understand my grandfather&rsquo;s
        meaning at all times.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is quite true,&rdquo; said Barrois; &ldquo;and that is what I
        told the gentleman as we walked along.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Permit me,&rdquo; said the notary, turning first to Villefort and
        then to Valentine&mdash;&ldquo;permit me to state that the case in
        question is just one of those in which a public officer like myself cannot
        proceed to act without thereby incurring a dangerous responsibility. The
        first thing necessary to render an act valid is, that the notary should be
        thoroughly convinced that he has faithfully interpreted the will and
        wishes of the person dictating the act. Now I cannot be sure of the
        approbation or disapprobation of a client who cannot speak, and as the
        object of his desire or his repugnance cannot be clearly proved to me, on
        account of his want of speech, my services here would be quite useless,
        and cannot be legally exercised.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The notary then prepared to retire. An imperceptible smile of triumph was expressed
        on the lips of the procureur. Noirtier looked at Valentine with an expression so
        full of grief, that she arrested the departure of the notary.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the language which I speak with my grandfather
        may be easily learnt, and I can teach you in a few minutes, to understand it
        almost as well as I can myself. Will you tell me what you require, in
        order to set your conscience quite at ease on the subject?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In order to render an act valid, I must be certain of the
        approbation or disapprobation of my client. Illness of body would not
        affect the validity of the deed, but sanity of mind is absolutely
        requisite.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, sir, by the help of two signs, with which I will acquaint you
        presently, you may ascertain with perfect certainty that my grandfather is
        still in the full possession of all his mental faculties. M. Noirtier,
        being deprived of voice and motion, is accustomed to convey his meaning by
        closing his eyes when he wishes to signify &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; and to wink
        when he means &lsquo;no.&rsquo; You now know quite enough to enable you to
        converse with M. Noirtier;&mdash;try.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Noirtier gave Valentine such a look of tenderness and gratitude that it was
        comprehended even by the notary himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have heard and understood what your granddaughter has been saying,
        sir, have you?&rdquo; asked the notary. Noirtier closed his eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you approve of what she said&mdash;that is to say, you declare that
        the signs which she mentioned are really those by means of which you are
        accustomed to convey your thoughts?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It was you who sent for me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To make your will?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you do not wish me to go away without fulfilling your original
        intentions?&rdquo; The old man winked violently.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said the young girl, &ldquo;do you understand now, and is
        your conscience perfectly at rest on the subject?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        But before the notary could answer, Villefort had drawn him aside.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;do you suppose for a moment that a man can
        sustain a physical shock, such as M. Noirtier has received, without any detriment
        to his mental faculties?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is not exactly that, sir,&rdquo; said the notary, &ldquo;which
        makes me uneasy, but the difficulty will be in wording his thoughts and
        intentions, so as to be able to get his answers.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You must see that to be an utter impossibility,&rdquo; said
        Villefort. Valentine and the old man heard this conversation, and Noirtier
        fixed his eye so earnestly on Valentine that she felt bound to answer to
        the look.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;that need not make you uneasy, however
        difficult it may at first sight appear to be. I can discover and explain
        to you my grandfather&rsquo;s thoughts, so as to put an end to all your
        doubts and fears on the subject. I have now been six years with M.
        Noirtier, and let him tell you if ever once, during that time, he has
        entertained a thought which he was unable to make me understand.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; signed the old man.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us try what we can do, then,&rdquo; said the notary. &ldquo;You
        accept this young lady as your interpreter, M. Noirtier?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, sir, what do you require of me, and what document is it that
        you wish to be drawn up?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine named all the letters of the alphabet until she came to W. At this
        letter the eloquent eye of Noirtier gave her notice that she was to stop.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is very evident that it is the letter W which M. Noirtier wants,&rdquo;
        said the notary.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Valentine; and, turning to her grandfather, she
        repeated, &ldquo;Wa&mdash;We&mdash;Wi&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; The old man stopped her
        at the last syllable. Valentine then took the dictionary, and the notary watched
        her while she turned over the pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        She passed her finger slowly down the columns, and when she came to the word
        &ldquo;Will,&rdquo; M. Noirtier&rsquo;s eye bade her stop.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Will,&rdquo; said the notary; &ldquo;it is very evident that M. Noirtier
        is desirous of making his will.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes,&rdquo; motioned the invalid.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Really, sir, you must allow that this is most extraordinary,&rdquo;
        said the astonished notary, turning to M. de Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the procureur, &ldquo;and I think the will promises to be
        yet more extraordinary, for I cannot see how it is to be drawn up without the
        intervention of Valentine, and she may, perhaps, be considered as too much
        interested in its contents to allow of her being a suitable interpreter of
        the obscure and ill-defined wishes of her grandfather.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo; replied the eye of the paralytic.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What?&rdquo; said Villefort, &ldquo;do you mean to say that
        Valentine is not interested in your will?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the notary, whose interest had been greatly
        excited, and who had resolved on publishing far and wide the account of
        this extraordinary and picturesque scene, &ldquo;what appeared so
        impossible to me an hour ago, has now become quite easy and practicable,
        and this may be a perfectly valid will, provided it be read in the
        presence of seven witnesses, approved by the testator, and sealed by the
        notary in the presence of the witnesses. As to the time, it will not
        require very much more than the generality of wills. There are certain
        forms necessary to be gone through, and which are always the same. As to
        the details, the greater part will be furnished afterwards by the state in
        which we find the affairs of the testator, and by yourself, who, having
        had the management of them, can doubtless give full information on the
        subject. But besides all this, in order that the instrument may not be
        contested, I am anxious to give it the greatest possible authenticity,
        therefore, one of my colleagues will help me, and, contrary to custom,
        will assist in the dictation of the testament. Are you satisfied, sir?&rdquo;
        continued the notary, addressing the old man.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30175m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; looked the invalid, his eye beaming with delight at the
        ready interpretation of his meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is he going to do?&rdquo; thought Villefort, whose position
        demanded much reserve, but who was longing to know what his father&rsquo;s
        intentions were. He left the room to give orders for another notary to be
        sent, but Barrois, who had heard all that passed, had guessed his master&rsquo;s
        wishes, and had already gone to fetch one. The procureur then told his
        wife to come up. In the course of a quarter of an hour everyone had
        assembled in the chamber of the paralytic; the second notary had also
        arrived.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few words sufficed for a mutual understanding between the two officers of the
        law. They read to Noirtier the formal copy of a will, in order to give him an
        idea of the terms in which such documents are generally couched; then, in order
        to test the capacity of the testator, the first notary said, turning towards him:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;When an individual makes his will, it is generally in favor or in prejudice
        of some person.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you an exact idea of the amount of your fortune?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will name to you several sums which will increase by gradation;
        you will stop me when I reach the one representing the amount of your own
        possessions?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a kind of solemnity in this interrogation. Never had the struggle
        between mind and matter been more apparent than now, and if it was not a sublime,
        it was, at least, a curious spectacle. They had formed a circle round the invalid;
        the second notary was sitting at a table, prepared for writing, and his colleague
        was standing before the testator in the act of interrogating him on the subject
        to which we have alluded.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your fortune exceeds 300,000 francs, does it not?&rdquo; asked he.
        Noirtier made a sign that it did.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you possess 400,000 francs?&rdquo; inquired the notary.
        Noirtier&rsquo;s eye remained immovable.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;500,000?&rdquo; The same expression continued.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;600,000&mdash;700,000&mdash;800,000&mdash;900,000?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Noirtier stopped him at the last-named sum.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are then in possession of 900,000 francs?&rdquo; asked the
        notary.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In landed property?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In stock?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The stock is in your own hands?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The look which M. Noirtier cast on Barrois showed that there was something
        wanting which he knew where to find. The old servant left the room, and presently
        returned, bringing with him a small casket.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you permit us to open this casket?&rdquo; asked the notary. Noirtier
        gave his assent.
      </p>
      <p>
        They opened it, and found 900,000 francs in bank scrip. The first notary handed
        over each note, as he examined it, to his colleague.
      </p>
      <p>
        The total amount was found to be as M. Noirtier had stated.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is all as he has said; it is very evident that the mind still retains its
        full force and vigor.&rdquo; Then, turning towards the paralytic, he said,
        &ldquo;You possess, then, 900,000 francs of capital, which, according to
        the manner in which you have invested it, ought to bring in an income of
        about 40,000 livres?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To whom do you desire to leave this fortune?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Madame de Villefort, &ldquo;there is not much doubt
        on that subject. M. Noirtier tenderly loves his granddaughter,
        Mademoiselle de Villefort; it is she who has nursed and tended him for six
        years, and has, by her devoted attention, fully secured the affection, I
        had almost said the gratitude, of her grandfather, and it is but just that
        she should reap the fruit of her devotion.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The eye of Noirtier clearly showed by its expression that he was not deceived by
        the false assent given by Madame de Villefort&rsquo;s words and manner to the
        motives which she supposed him to entertain.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is it, then, to Mademoiselle Valentine de Villefort that you leave these
        900,000 francs?&rdquo; demanded the notary, thinking he had only to insert this
        clause, but waiting first for the assent of Noirtier, which it was necessary should
        be given before all the witnesses of this singular scene.
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine, when her name was made the subject of discussion, had stepped back, to
        escape unpleasant observation; her eyes were cast down, and she was crying. The
        old man looked at her for an instant with an expression of the deepest
        tenderness, then, turning towards the notary, he significantly winked his
        eye in token of dissent.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What,&rdquo; said the notary, &ldquo;do you not intend making
        Mademoiselle Valentine de Villefort your residuary legatee?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are not making any mistake, are you?&rdquo; said the notary;
        &ldquo;you really mean to declare that such is not your intention?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; repeated Noirtier; &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine raised her head, struck dumb with astonishment. It was not so much the
        conviction that she was disinherited that caused her grief, but her total inability
        to account for the feelings which had provoked her grandfather to such an
        act. But Noirtier looked at her with so much affectionate tenderness that
        she exclaimed:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, grandpapa, I see now that it is only your fortune of which you deprive
        me; you still leave me the love which I have always enjoyed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, yes, most assuredly,&rdquo; said the eyes of the paralytic, for
        he closed them with an expression which Valentine could not mistake.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you, thank you,&rdquo; murmured she. The old man&rsquo;s
        declaration that Valentine was not the destined inheritor of his fortune
        had excited the hopes of Madame de Villefort; she gradually approached the
        invalid, and said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then, doubtless, dear M. Noirtier, you intend leaving your fortune to your
        grandson, Edward de Villefort?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The winking of the eyes which answered this speech was most decided and terrible,
        and expressed a feeling almost amounting to hatred.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No?&rdquo; said the notary; &ldquo;then, perhaps, it is to your
        son, M. de Villefort?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo; The two notaries looked at each other in mute
        astonishment and inquiry as to what were the real intentions of the
        testator. Villefort and his wife both grew red, one from shame, the other
        from anger.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What have we all done, then, dear grandpapa?&rdquo; said Valentine;
        &ldquo;you no longer seem to love any of us?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The old man&rsquo;s eyes passed rapidly from Villefort and his wife, and rested
        on Valentine with a look of unutterable fondness.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;if you love me, grandpapa, try and bring
        that love to bear upon your actions at this present moment. You know me well
        enough to be quite sure that I have never thought of your fortune; besides, they
        say I am already rich in right of my mother&mdash;too rich, even. Explain
        yourself, then.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Noirtier fixed his intelligent eyes on Valentine&rsquo;s hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My hand?&rdquo; said she.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Her hand!&rdquo; exclaimed everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, gentlemen, you see it is all useless, and that my father&rsquo;s
        mind is really impaired,&rdquo; said Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; cried Valentine suddenly, &ldquo;I understand. It is my
        marriage you mean, is it not, dear grandpapa?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, yes,&rdquo; signed the paralytic, casting on Valentine a
        look of joyful gratitude for having guessed his meaning.

      <p>
        &ldquo;You are angry with us all on account of this marriage, are you not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Really, this is too absurd,&rdquo; said Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Excuse me, sir,&rdquo; replied the notary; &ldquo;on the contrary,
        the meaning of M. Noirtier is quite evident to me, and I can quite easily
        connect the train of ideas passing in his mind.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You do not wish me to marry M. Franz d&rsquo;Épinay?&rdquo;
        observed Valentine.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not wish it,&rdquo; said the eye of her grandfather.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you disinherit your granddaughter,&rdquo; continued the notary,
        &ldquo;because she has contracted an engagement contrary to your wishes?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So that, but for this marriage, she would have been your heir?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a profound silence. The two notaries were holding a consultation as to
        the best means of proceeding with the affair. Valentine was looking at her
        grandfather with a smile of intense gratitude, and Villefort was biting his lips
        with vexation, while Madame de Villefort could not succeed in repressing an inward
        feeling of joy, which, in spite of herself, appeared in her whole countenance.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Villefort, who was the first to break the silence,
        &ldquo;I consider that I am the best judge of the propriety of the marriage in
        question. I am the only person possessing the right to dispose of my
        daughter&rsquo;s hand. It is my wish that she should marry M. Franz
        d&rsquo;Épinay&mdash;and she shall marry him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine sank weeping into a chair.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the notary, &ldquo;how do you intend disposing of
        your fortune in case Mademoiselle de Villefort still determines on
        marrying M. Franz?&rdquo; The old man gave no answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You will, of course, dispose of it in some way or other?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In favor of some member of your family?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you intend devoting it to charitable purposes, then?&rdquo;
        pursued the notary.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the notary, &ldquo;you are aware that the law does
        not allow a son to be entirely deprived of his patrimony?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You only intend, then, to dispose of that part of your fortune
        which the law allows you to subtract from the inheritance of your son?&rdquo;
        Noirtier made no answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you still wish to dispose of all?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But they will contest the will after your death?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My father knows me,&rdquo; replied Villefort; &ldquo;he is quite
        sure that his wishes will be held sacred by me; besides, he understands
        that in my position I cannot plead against the poor.&rdquo; The eye of
        Noirtier beamed with triumph.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you decide on, sir?&rdquo; asked the notary of Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing, sir; it is a resolution which my father has taken and I
        know he never alters his mind. I am quite resigned. These 900,000 francs
        will go out of the family in order to enrich some hospital; but it is
        ridiculous thus to yield to the caprices of an old man, and I shall,
        therefore, act according to my conscience.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Having said this, Villefort quitted the room with his wife, leaving his father at
        liberty to do as he pleased. The same day the will was made, the witnesses were
        brought, it was approved by the old man, sealed in the presence of all and
        given in charge to M. Deschamps, the family notary.
