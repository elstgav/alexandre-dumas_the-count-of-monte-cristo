      <h2>Chapter 42. Monsieur Bertuccio</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>eanwhile the count
        had arrived at his house; it had taken him six minutes to perform the
        distance, but these six minutes were sufficient to induce twenty young men
        who knew the price of the equipage they had been unable to purchase
        themselves, to put their horses in a gallop in order to see the rich
        foreigner who could afford to give 20,000 francs apiece for his horses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The house Ali had chosen, and which was to serve as a town residence to
        Monte Cristo, was situated on the right hand as you ascend the
        Champs-Élysées. A thick clump of trees and shrubs rose in the centre, and
        masked a portion of the front; around this shrubbery two alleys, like two
        arms, extended right and left, and formed a carriage-drive from the iron
        gates to a double portico, on every step of which stood a porcelain vase,
        filled with flowers. This house, isolated from the rest, had, besides the
        main entrance, another in the Rue de Ponthieu. Even before the coachman had
        hailed the <i>concierge</i>, the massy gates rolled on their hinges&mdash;they
        had seen the Count coming, and at Paris, as everywhere else, he was served
        with the rapidity of lightning. The coachman entered and traversed the
        half-circle without slackening his speed, and the gates were closed ere
        the wheels had ceased to sound on the gravel. The carriage stopped at the
        left side of the portico, two men presented themselves at the
        carriage-window; the one was Ali, who, smiling with an expression of the
        most sincere joy, seemed amply repaid by a mere look from Monte Cristo.
        The other bowed respectfully, and offered his arm to assist the count in
        descending.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thanks, M. Bertuccio,&rdquo; said the count, springing lightly up the
        three steps of the portico; &ldquo;and the notary?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is in the small salon, excellency,&rdquo; returned Bertuccio.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And the cards I ordered to be engraved as soon as you knew the
        number of the house?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your excellency, it is done already. I have been myself to the best
        engraver of the Palais Royal, who did the plate in my presence. The first
        card struck off was taken, according to your orders, to the Baron
        Danglars, Rue de la Chaussée d&rsquo;Antin, No. 7; the others are on the
        mantle-piece of your excellency&rsquo;s bedroom.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Good; what o&rsquo;clock is it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Four o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo gave his hat, cane, and gloves to the same French footman who had
        called his carriage at the Count of Morcerf&rsquo;s, and then he passed into the
        small salon, preceded by Bertuccio, who showed him the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;These are but indifferent marbles in this antechamber,&rdquo; said Monte
        Cristo. &ldquo;I trust all this will soon be taken away.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Bertuccio bowed. As the steward had said, the notary awaited him in the small
        salon. He was a simple-looking lawyer&rsquo;s clerk, elevated to the extraordinary
        dignity of a provincial scrivener.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are the notary empowered to sell the country house that I wish to
        purchase, monsieur?&rdquo; asked Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, count,&rdquo; returned the notary.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is the deed of sale ready?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, count.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you brought it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Here it is.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well; and where is this house that I purchase?&rdquo; asked
        the count carelessly, addressing himself half to Bertuccio, half to the
        notary. The steward made a gesture that signified, &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;
        The notary looked at the count with astonishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;does not the count know where the house he
        purchases is situated?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The count does not know?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How should I know? I have arrived from Cadiz this morning. I have
        never before been at Paris, and it is the first time I have ever even set
        my foot in France.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, that is different; the house you purchase is at Auteuil.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At these words Bertuccio turned pale.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And where is Auteuil?&rdquo; asked the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Close by here, monsieur,&rdquo; replied the notary&mdash;&ldquo;a
        little beyond Passy; a charming situation, in the heart of the Bois de
        Boulogne.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So near as that?&rdquo; said the Count; &ldquo;but that is not in
        the country. What made you choose a house at the gates of Paris, M.
        Bertuccio?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I,&rdquo; cried the steward with a strange expression. &ldquo;His
        excellency did not charge me to purchase this house. If his excellency
        will recollect&mdash;if he will think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, true,&rdquo; observed Monte Cristo; &ldquo;I recollect now. I
        read the advertisement in one of the papers, and was tempted by the false
        title, &lsquo;a country house.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is not yet too late,&rdquo; cried Bertuccio, eagerly; &ldquo;and
        if your excellency will intrust me with the commission, I will find you a
        better at Enghien, at Fontenay-aux-Roses, or at Bellevue.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; returned Monte Cristo negligently; &ldquo;since I
        have this, I will keep it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you are quite right,&rdquo; said the notary, who feared to lose
        his fee. &ldquo;It is a charming place, well supplied with spring-water
        and fine trees; a comfortable habitation, although abandoned for a long
        time, without reckoning the furniture, which, although old, is yet
        valuable, now that old things are so much sought after. I suppose the
        count has the tastes of the day?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To be sure,&rdquo; returned Monte Cristo; &ldquo;it is very
        convenient, then?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is more&mdash;it is magnificent.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Peste!</i> let us not lose such an opportunity,&rdquo; returned
        Monte Cristo. &ldquo;The deed, if you please, Mr. Notary.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And he signed it rapidly, after having first run his eye over that part of the
        deed in which were specified the situation of the house and the names of
        the proprietors.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bertuccio,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;give fifty-five thousand francs to
        monsieur.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The steward left the room with a faltering step, and returned with a bundle of
        bank-notes, which the notary counted like a man who never gives a receipt for
        money until after he is sure it is all there.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; demanded the count, &ldquo;are all the forms complied
        with?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;All, sir.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you the keys?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They are in the hands of the concierge, who takes care of the
        house, but here is the order I have given him to install the count in his
        new possessions.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well;&rdquo; and Monte Cristo made a sign with his hand to the
        notary, which said, &ldquo;I have no further need of you; you may go.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; observed the honest notary, &ldquo;the count is, I
        think, mistaken; it is only fifty thousand francs, everything included.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And your fee?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is included in this sum.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But have you not come from Auteuil here?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, certainly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, it is but fair that you should be paid for your loss of
        time and trouble,&rdquo; said the count; and he made a gesture of polite dismissal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The notary left the room backwards, and bowing down to the ground; it was the
        first time he had ever met a similar client.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;See this gentleman out,&rdquo; said the count to Bertuccio. And the steward
        followed the notary out of the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scarcely was the count alone, when he drew from his pocket a book closed with a
        lock, and opened it with a key which he wore round his neck, and which never left
        him. After having sought for a few minutes, he stopped at a leaf which had several
        notes, and compared them with the deed of sale, which lay on the table, and
        recalling his <i>souvenirs</i>&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Auteuil, Rue de la Fontaine, No. 28;&rsquo; it is indeed the
        same,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and now, am I to rely upon an avowal extorted
        by religious or physical terror? However, in an hour I shall know all.
        Bertuccio!&rdquo; cried he, striking a light hammer with a pliant handle
        on a small gong. &ldquo;Bertuccio!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The steward appeared at the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Monsieur Bertuccio,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;did you never tell me
        that you had travelled in France?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In some parts of France&mdash;yes, excellency.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You know the environs of Paris, then?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, excellency, no,&rdquo; returned the steward, with a sort of
        nervous trembling, which Monte Cristo, a connoisseur in all emotions,
        rightly attributed to great disquietude.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is unfortunate,&rdquo; returned he, &ldquo;that you have never
        visited the environs, for I wish to see my new property this evening, and
        had you gone with me, you could have given me some useful information.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To Auteuil!&rdquo; cried Bertuccio, whose copper complexion became
        livid&mdash;&ldquo;I go to Auteuil?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what is there surprising in that? When I live at Auteuil, you
        must come there, as you belong to my service.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Bertuccio hung down his head before the imperious look of his master, and remained
        motionless, without making any answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, what has happened to you?&mdash;are you going to make me ring a second
        time for the carriage?&rdquo; asked Monte Cristo, in the same tone that Louis XIV.
        pronounced the famous, &ldquo;I have been almost obliged to wait.&rdquo; Bertuccio
        made but one bound to the antechamber, and cried in a hoarse voice:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;His excellency&rsquo;s horses!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo wrote two or three notes, and, as he sealed the last, the steward
        appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your excellency&rsquo;s carriage is at the door,&rdquo; said he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, take your hat and gloves,&rdquo; returned Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Am I to accompany you, your excellency?&rdquo; cried Bertuccio.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly, you must give the orders, for I intend residing at the
        house.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20277m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        It was unexampled for a servant of the count&rsquo;s to dare
        to dispute an order of his, so the steward, without saying a word,
        followed his master, who got into the carriage, and signed to him to
        follow, which he did, taking his place respectfully on the front seat.
