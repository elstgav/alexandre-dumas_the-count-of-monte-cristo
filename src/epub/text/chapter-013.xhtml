      <h2>Chapter 13. The Hundred Days</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>. Noirtier was a
        true prophet, and things progressed rapidly, as he had predicted. Everyone
        knows the history of the famous return from Elba, a return which was
        unprecedented in the past, and will probably remain without a counterpart
        in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Louis XVIII. made but a faint attempt to parry this unexpected blow; the
        monarchy he had scarcely reconstructed tottered on its precarious
        foundation, and at a sign from the emperor the incongruous structure of
        ancient prejudices and new ideas fell to the ground. Villefort, therefore,
        gained nothing save the king&rsquo;s gratitude (which was rather likely to
        injure him at the present time) and the cross of the Legion of Honor,
        which he had the prudence not to wear, although M. de Blacas had duly
        forwarded the brevet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Napoleon would, doubtless, have deprived Villefort of his office had it
        not been for Noirtier, who was all powerful at court, and thus the
        Girondin of &rsquo;93 and the Senator of 1806 protected him who so lately
        had been his protector. All Villefort&rsquo;s influence barely enabled him
        to stifle the secret Dantès had so nearly divulged. The king&rsquo;s
        procureur alone was deprived of his office, being suspected of royalism.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, scarcely was the imperial power established&mdash;that is,
        scarcely had the emperor re-entered the Tuileries and begun to issue
        orders from the closet into which we have introduced our readers,&mdash;he
        found on the table there Louis XVIII.&rsquo;s half-filled snuff-box,&mdash;scarcely
        had this occurred when Marseilles began, in spite of the authorities, to
        rekindle the flames of civil war, always smouldering in the south, and it
        required but little to excite the populace to acts of far greater violence
        than the shouts and insults with which they assailed the royalists
        whenever they ventured abroad.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0159m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        Owing to this change, the worthy shipowner became at that moment&mdash;we
        will not say all powerful, because Morrel was a prudent and rather a timid
        man, so much so, that many of the most zealous partisans of Bonaparte
        accused him of &ldquo;moderation&rdquo;&mdash;but sufficiently influential
        to make a demand in favor of Dantès.
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort retained his place, but his marriage was put off until a more
        favorable opportunity. If the emperor remained on the throne, Gérard
        required a different alliance to aid his career; if Louis XVIII. returned,
        the influence of M. de Saint-Méran, like his own, could be vastly
        increased, and the marriage be still more suitable. The deputy procureur
        was, therefore, the first magistrate of Marseilles, when one morning his
        door opened, and M. Morrel was announced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone else would have hastened to receive him; but Villefort was a man of
        ability, and he knew this would be a sign of weakness. He made Morrel wait
        in the antechamber, although he had no one with him, for the simple reason
        that the king&rsquo;s procureur always makes everyone wait, and after
        passing a quarter of an hour in reading the papers, he ordered M. Morrel
        to be admitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel expected Villefort would be dejected; he found him as he had found
        him six weeks before, calm, firm, and full of that glacial politeness,
        that most insurmountable barrier which separates the well-bred from the
        vulgar man.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had entered Villefort&rsquo;s office expecting that the magistrate
        would tremble at the sight of him; on the contrary, he felt a cold shudder
        all over him when he saw Villefort sitting there with his elbow on his
        desk, and his head leaning on his hand. He stopped at the door; Villefort
        gazed at him as if he had some difficulty in recognizing him; then, after
        a brief interval, during which the honest shipowner turned his hat in his
        hands,
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. Morrel, I believe?&rdquo; said Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come nearer,&rdquo; said the magistrate, with a patronizing wave of
        the hand, &ldquo;and tell me to what circumstance I owe the honor of this
        visit.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you not guess, monsieur?&rdquo; asked Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not in the least; but if I can serve you in any way I shall be
        delighted.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Everything depends on you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Explain yourself, pray.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Morrel, recovering his assurance as he
        proceeded, &ldquo;do you recollect that a few days before the landing of
        his majesty the emperor, I came to intercede for a young man, the mate of
        my ship, who was accused of being concerned in correspondence with the
        Island of Elba? What was the other day a crime is today a title to favor.
        You then served Louis XVIII., and you did not show any favor&mdash;it was
        your duty; today you serve Napoleon, and you ought to protect him&mdash;it
        is equally your duty; I come, therefore, to ask what has become of him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0161m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        Villefort by a strong effort sought to control himself. &ldquo;What is his
        name?&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Tell me his name.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Edmond Dantès.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort would probably have rather stood opposite the muzzle of a pistol
        at five-and-twenty paces than have heard this name spoken; but he did not
        blanch.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Dantès,&rdquo; repeated he, &ldquo;Edmond Dantès.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, monsieur.&rdquo; Villefort opened a large register, then went
        to a table, from the table turned to his registers, and then, turning to
        Morrel,
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you quite sure you are not mistaken, monsieur?&rdquo; said he,
        in the most natural tone in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Had Morrel been a more quick-sighted man, or better versed in these
        matters, he would have been surprised at the king&rsquo;s procureur
        answering him on such a subject, instead of referring him to the governors
        of the prison or the prefect of the department. But Morrel, disappointed
        in his expectations of exciting fear, was conscious only of the other&rsquo;s
        condescension. Villefort had calculated rightly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Morrel; &ldquo;I am not mistaken. I have known him
        for ten years, the last four of which he was in my service. Do not you
        recollect, I came about six weeks ago to plead for clemency, as I come
        today to plead for justice. You received me very coldly. Oh, the royalists
        were very severe with the Bonapartists in those days.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; returned Villefort, &ldquo;I was then a royalist,
        because I believed the Bourbons not only the heirs to the throne, but the
        chosen of the nation. The miraculous return of Napoleon has conquered me,
        the legitimate monarch is he who is loved by his people.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; cried Morrel. &ldquo;I like to hear you
        speak thus, and I augur well for Edmond from it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Wait a moment,&rdquo; said Villefort, turning over the leaves of a
        register; &ldquo;I have it&mdash;a sailor, who was about to marry a young
        Catalan girl. I recollect now; it was a very serious charge.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You know that when he left here he was taken to the Palais de
        Justice.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I made my report to the authorities at Paris, and a week after he
        was carried off.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Carried off!&rdquo; said Morrel. &ldquo;What can they have done
        with him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, he has been taken to Fenestrelles, to Pignerol, or to the
        Sainte-Marguérite islands. Some fine morning he will return to take
        command of your vessel.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come when he will, it shall be kept for him. But how is it he is
        not already returned? It seems to me the first care of government should
        be to set at liberty those who have suffered for their adherence to it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do not be too hasty, M. Morrel,&rdquo; replied Villefort. &ldquo;The
        order of imprisonment came from high authority, and the order for his
        liberation must proceed from the same source; and, as Napoleon has
        scarcely been reinstated a fortnight, the letters have not yet been
        forwarded.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Morrel, &ldquo;is there no way of expediting all
        these formalities&mdash;of releasing him from arrest?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There has been no arrest.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is sometimes essential to government to cause a man&rsquo;s
        disappearance without leaving any traces, so that no written forms or
        documents may defeat their wishes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It might be so under the Bourbons, but at present&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It has always been so, my dear Morrel, since the reign of Louis
        XIV. The emperor is more strict in prison discipline than even Louis
        himself, and the number of prisoners whose names are not on the register
        is incalculable.&rdquo; Had Morrel even any suspicions, so much kindness
        would have dispelled them.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, M. de Villefort, how would you advise me to act?&rdquo; asked
        he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Petition the minister.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I know what that is; the minister receives two hundred
        petitions every day, and does not read three.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is true; but he will read a petition countersigned and
        presented by me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And will you undertake to deliver it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With the greatest pleasure. Dantès was then guilty, and now he is
        innocent, and it is as much my duty to free him as it was to condemn him.&rdquo;
        Villefort thus forestalled any danger of an inquiry, which, however
        improbable it might be, if it did take place would leave him defenceless.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But how shall I address the minister?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sit down there,&rdquo; said Villefort, giving up his place to
        Morrel, &ldquo;and write what I dictate.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Will you be so good?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly. But lose no time; we have lost too much already.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is true. Only think what the poor fellow may even now be
        suffering.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort shuddered at the suggestion; but he had gone too far to draw back.
        Dantès must be crushed to gratify Villefort&rsquo;s ambition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort dictated a petition, in which, from an excellent intention, no
        doubt, Dantès&rsquo; patriotic services were exaggerated, and he was made
        out one of the most active agents of Napoleon&rsquo;s return. It was
        evident that at the sight of this document the minister would instantly
        release him. The petition finished, Villefort read it aloud.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;leave the rest to me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Will the petition go soon?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Today.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Countersigned by you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The best thing I can do will be to certify the truth of the
        contents of your petition.&rdquo; And, sitting down, Villefort wrote the
        certificate at the bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What more is to be done?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will do whatever is necessary.&rdquo; This assurance delighted
        Morrel, who took leave of Villefort, and hastened to announce to old
        Dantès that he would soon see his son.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for Villefort, instead of sending to Paris, he carefully preserved the
        petition that so fearfully compromised Dantès, in the hopes of an event
        that seemed not unlikely,&mdash;that is, a second restoration. Dantès
        remained a prisoner, and heard not the noise of the fall of Louis XVIII.&rsquo;s
        throne, or the still more tragic destruction of the empire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Twice during the Hundred Days had Morrel renewed his demand, and twice had
        Villefort soothed him with promises. At last there was Waterloo, and
        Morrel came no more; he had done all that was in his power, and any fresh
        attempt would only compromise himself uselessly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Louis XVIII. remounted the throne; Villefort, to whom Marseilles had
        become filled with remorseful memories, sought and obtained the situation
        of king&rsquo;s procureur at Toulouse, and a fortnight afterwards he
        married Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, whose father now stood higher at
        court than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        And so Dantès, after the Hundred Days and after Waterloo, remained in his
        dungeon, forgotten of earth and heaven.
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars comprehended the full extent of the wretched fate that overwhelmed
        Dantès; and, when Napoleon returned to France, he, after the manner of mediocre
        minds, termed the coincidence, <i>a decree of Providence</i>. But when Napoleon
        returned to Paris, Danglars&rsquo; heart failed him, and he lived in constant
        fear of Dantès&rsquo; return on a mission of vengeance. He therefore informed M.
        Morrel of his wish to quit the sea, and obtained a recommendation from him
        to a Spanish merchant, into whose service he entered at the end of March,
        that is, ten or twelve days after Napoleon&rsquo;s return. He then left
        for Madrid, and was no more heard of.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fernand understood nothing except that Dantès was absent. What had become
        of him he cared not to inquire. Only, during the respite the absence of
        his rival afforded him, he reflected, partly on the means of deceiving
        Mercédès as to the cause of his absence, partly on plans of emigration and
        abduction, as from time to time he sat sad and motionless on the summit of
        Cape Pharo, at the spot from whence Marseilles and the Catalans are
        visible, watching for the apparition of a young and handsome man, who was
        for him also the messenger of vengeance. Fernand&rsquo;s mind was made up;
        he would shoot Dantès, and then kill himself. But Fernand was mistaken; a
        man of his disposition never kills himself, for he constantly hopes.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this time the empire made its last conscription, and every man in
        France capable of bearing arms rushed to obey the summons of the emperor.
        Fernand departed with the rest, bearing with him the terrible thought that
        while he was away, his rival would perhaps return and marry Mercédès. Had
        Fernand really meant to kill himself, he would have done so when he parted
        from Mercédès. His devotion, and the compassion he showed for her
        misfortunes, produced the effect they always produce on noble minds&mdash;Mercédès
        had always had a sincere regard for Fernand, and this was now strengthened
        by gratitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My brother,&rdquo; said she, as she placed his knapsack on his
        shoulders, &ldquo;be careful of yourself, for if you are killed, I shall
        be alone in the world.&rdquo; These words carried a ray of hope into
        Fernand&rsquo;s heart. Should Dantès not return, Mercédès might one day be
        his.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0165m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        Mercédès was left alone face to face with the vast plain that had never
        seemed so barren, and the sea that had never seemed so vast. Bathed in
        tears she wandered about the Catalan village. Sometimes she stood mute and
        motionless as a statue, looking towards Marseilles, at other times gazing
        on the sea, and debating as to whether it were not better to cast herself
        into the abyss of the ocean, and thus end her woes. It was not want of
        courage that prevented her putting this resolution into execution; but her
        religious feelings came to her aid and saved her.
      </p>
      <p>
        Caderousse was, like Fernand, enrolled in the army, but, being married and
        eight years older, he was merely sent to the frontier. Old Dantès, who was
        only sustained by hope, lost all hope at Napoleon&rsquo;s downfall. Five
        months after he had been separated from his son, and almost at the hour of
        his arrest, he breathed his last in Mercédès&rsquo; arms. M. Morrel paid
        the expenses of his funeral, and a few small debts the poor old man had
        contracted.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was more than benevolence in this action; there was courage; the
        south was aflame, and to assist, even on his death-bed, the father of so
        dangerous a Bonapartist as Dantès, was stigmatized as a crime.
