      <h2>Chapter 80. The Accusation</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">

        soon restored the magistrate to consciousness, who had looked like a
        second corpse in that chamber of death.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, death is in my house!&rdquo; cried Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Say, rather, crime!&rdquo; replied the doctor.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. d&rsquo;Avrigny,&rdquo; cried Villefort, &ldquo;I cannot tell
        you all I feel at this moment,&mdash;terror, grief, madness.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said M. d&rsquo;Avrigny, with an imposing calmness,
        &ldquo;but I think it is now time to act. I think it is time to stop this
        torrent of mortality. I can no longer bear to be in possession of these secrets
        without the hope of seeing the victims and society generally revenged.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort cast a gloomy look around him. &ldquo;In my house,&rdquo; murmured
        he, &ldquo;in my house!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, magistrate,&rdquo; said M. d&rsquo;Avrigny, &ldquo;show
        yourself a man; as an interpreter of the law, do honor to your profession
        by sacrificing your selfish interests to it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You make me shudder, doctor. Do you talk of a sacrifice?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you then suspect anyone?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I suspect no one; death raps at your door&mdash;it enters&mdash;it
        goes, not blindfolded, but circumspectly, from room to room. Well, I
        follow its course, I track its passage; I adopt the wisdom of the
        ancients, and feel my way, for my friendship for your family and my
        respect for you are as a twofold bandage over my eyes; well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, speak, speak, doctor; I shall have courage.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, sir, you have in your establishment, or in your family,
        perhaps, one of the frightful monstrosities of which each century produces
        only one. Locusta and Agrippina, living at the same time, were an
        exception, and proved the determination of Providence to effect the entire
        ruin of the Roman empire, sullied by so many crimes. Brunhilda and
        Fredegund were the results of the painful struggle of civilization in its
        infancy, when man was learning to control mind, were it even by an
        emissary from the realms of darkness. All these women had been, or were,
        beautiful. The same flower of innocence had flourished, or was still
        flourishing, on their brow, that is seen on the brow of the culprit in
        your house.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40120m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        Villefort shrieked, clasped his hands, and looked at the doctor with a
        supplicating air. But the latter went on without pity:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Seek whom the crime will profit,&rsquo; says an axiom of
        jurisprudence.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Doctor,&rdquo; cried Villefort, &ldquo;alas, doctor, how often has
        man&rsquo;s justice been deceived by those fatal words. I know not why,
        but I feel that this crime&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You acknowledge, then, the existence of the crime?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I see too plainly that it does exist. But it seems that it is
        intended to affect me personally. I fear an attack myself, after all these
        disasters.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, man!&rdquo; murmured d&rsquo;Avrigny, &ldquo;the most selfish
        of all animals, the most personal of all creatures, who believes the earth
        turns, the sun shines, and death strikes for him alone,&mdash;an ant
        cursing God from the top of a blade of grass! And have those who have lost
        their lives lost nothing?&mdash;M. de Saint-Méran, Madame de Saint-Méran,
        M. Noirtier&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How? M. Noirtier?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; think you it was the poor servant&rsquo;s life was coveted?
        No, no; like Shakespeare&rsquo;s Polonius, he died for another. It was Noirtier
        the lemonade was intended for&mdash;it is Noirtier, logically speaking, who drank
        it. The other drank it only by accident, and, although Barrois is dead, it was
        Noirtier whose death was wished for.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But why did it not kill my father?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I told you one evening in the garden after Madame de Saint-Méran&rsquo;s
        death&mdash;because his system is accustomed to that very poison, and the
        dose was trifling to him, which would be fatal to another; because no one
        knows, not even the assassin, that, for the last twelve months, I have
        given M. Noirtier brucine for his paralytic affection, while the assassin
        is not ignorant, for he has proved that brucine is a violent poison.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, have pity&mdash;have pity!&rdquo; murmured Villefort, wringing
        his hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Follow the culprit&rsquo;s steps; he first kills M. de Saint-Méran&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, doctor!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I would swear to it; what I heard of his symptoms agrees too well
        with what I have seen in the other cases.&rdquo; Villefort ceased to
        contend; he only groaned. &ldquo;He first kills M. de Saint-Méran,&rdquo;
        repeated the doctor, &ldquo;then Madame de Saint-Méran,&mdash;a double
        fortune to inherit.&rdquo; Villefort wiped the perspiration from his
        forehead. &ldquo;Listen attentively.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; stammered Villefort, &ldquo;I do not lose a single
        word.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. Noirtier,&rdquo; resumed M. d&rsquo;Avrigny in the same pitiless
        tone,&mdash;&ldquo;M. Noirtier had once made a will against you&mdash;against
        your family&mdash;in favor of the poor, in fact; M. Noirtier is spared,
        because nothing is expected from him. But he has no sooner destroyed his
        first will and made a second, than, for fear he should make a third, he is
        struck down. The will was made the day before yesterday, I believe; you
        see there has been no time lost.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, mercy, M. d&rsquo;Avrigny!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No mercy, sir! The physician has a sacred mission on earth; and to
        fulfil it he begins at the source of life, and goes down to the mysterious
        darkness of the tomb. When crime has been committed, and God, doubtless in
        anger, turns away his face, it is for the physician to bring the culprit
        to justice.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40122m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have mercy on my child, sir,&rdquo; murmured Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You see it is yourself who have first named her&mdash;you, her
        father.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have pity on Valentine! Listen, it is impossible. I would as
        willingly accuse myself! Valentine, whose heart is pure as a diamond or a
        lily!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No pity, procureur; the crime is fragrant. Mademoiselle herself
        packed all the medicines which were sent to M. de Saint-Méran; and M. de
        Saint-Méran is dead. Mademoiselle de Villefort prepared all the cooling
        draughts which Madame de Saint-Méran took, and Madame de Saint-Méran is
        dead. Mademoiselle de Villefort took from the hands of Barrois, who was
        sent out, the lemonade which M. Noirtier had every morning, and he has
        escaped by a miracle. Mademoiselle de Villefort is the culprit&mdash;she
        is the poisoner! To you, as the king&rsquo;s attorney, I denounce
        Mademoiselle de Villefort, do your duty.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Doctor, I resist no longer&mdash;I can no longer defend myself&mdash;I
        believe you; but, for pity&rsquo;s sake, spare my life, my honor!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. de Villefort,&rdquo; replied the doctor, with increased
        vehemence, &ldquo;there are occasions when I dispense with all foolish
        human circumspection. If your daughter had committed only one crime, and I
        saw her meditating another, I would say &lsquo;Warn her, punish her, let
        her pass the remainder of her life in a convent, weeping and praying.&rsquo;
        If she had committed two crimes, I would say, &lsquo;Here, M. de
        Villefort, is a poison that the prisoner is not acquainted with,&mdash;one
        that has no known antidote, quick as thought, rapid as lightning, mortal
        as the thunderbolt; give her that poison, recommending her soul to God,
        and save your honor and your life, for it is yours she aims at; and I can
        picture her approaching your pillow with her hypocritical smiles and her
        sweet exhortations. Woe to you, M. de Villefort, if you do not strike
        first!&rsquo; This is what I would say had she only killed two persons but
        she has seen three deaths,&mdash;has contemplated three murdered persons,&mdash;has
        knelt by three corpses! To the scaffold with the poisoner&mdash;to the
        scaffold! Do you talk of your honor? Do what I tell you, and immortality
        awaits you!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort fell on his knees.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I have not the strength of mind you have,
        or rather that which you would not have, if instead of my daughter Valentine your
        daughter Madeleine were concerned.&rdquo; The doctor turned pale. &ldquo;Doctor,
        every son of woman is born to suffer and to die; I am content to suffer and to
        await death.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Beware,&rdquo; said M. d&rsquo;Avrigny, &ldquo;it may come slowly;
        you will see it approach after having struck your father, your wife,
        perhaps your son.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort, suffocating, pressed the doctor&rsquo;s arm.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40124m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; cried he; &ldquo;pity me&mdash;help me! No, my daughter is
        not guilty. If you drag us both before a tribunal I will still say, &lsquo;No, my
        daughter is not guilty;&mdash;there is no crime in my house. I will not
        acknowledge a crime in my house; for when crime enters a dwelling, it is
        like death&mdash;it does not come alone.&rsquo; Listen. What does it
        signify to you if I am murdered? Are you my friend? Are you a man? Have
        you a heart? No, you are a physician! Well, I tell you I will not drag my
        daughter before a tribunal, and give her up to the executioner! The bare
        idea would kill me&mdash;would drive me like a madman to dig my heart out
        with my finger-nails! And if you were mistaken, doctor&mdash;if it were
        not my daughter&mdash;if I should come one day, pale as a spectre, and say
        to you, &lsquo;Assassin, you have killed my child!&rsquo;&mdash;hold&mdash;if
        that should happen, although I am a Christian, M. d&rsquo;Avrigny, I
        should kill myself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the doctor, after a moment&rsquo;s silence,
        &ldquo;I will wait.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort looked at him as if he had doubted his words.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Only,&rdquo; continued M. d&rsquo;Avrigny, with a slow and solemn tone,
        &ldquo;if anyone falls ill in your house, if you feel yourself attacked, do not
        send for me, for I will come no more. I will consent to share this dreadful secret
        with you, but I will not allow shame and remorse to grow and increase in my
        conscience, as crime and misery will in your house.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you abandon me, doctor?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, for I can follow you no farther, and I only stop at the foot
        of the scaffold. Some further discovery will be made, which will bring
        this dreadful tragedy to a close. Adieu.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I entreat you, doctor!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;All the horrors that disturb my thoughts make your house odious and
        fatal. Adieu, sir.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;One word&mdash;one single word more, doctor! You go, leaving me in
        all the horror of my situation, after increasing it by what you have
        revealed to me. But what will be reported of the sudden death of the poor
        old servant?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said M. d&rsquo;Avrigny; &ldquo;we will return.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The doctor went out first, followed by M. de Villefort. The terrified
        servants were on the stairs and in the passage where the doctor would pass.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said d&rsquo;Avrigny to Villefort, so loud that
        all might hear, &ldquo;poor Barrois has led too sedentary a life of late;
        accustomed formerly to ride on horseback, or in the carriage, to the four
        corners of Europe, the monotonous walk around that armchair has killed him&mdash;his
        blood has thickened. He was stout, had a short, thick neck; he was
        attacked with apoplexy, and I was called in too late. By the way,&rdquo;
        added he in a low tone, &ldquo;take care to throw away that cup of syrup
        of violets in the ashes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The doctor, without shaking hands with Villefort, without adding a word to
        what he had said, went out, amid the tears and lamentations of the whole
        household. The same evening all Villefort&rsquo;s servants, who had
        assembled in the kitchen, and had a long consultation, came to tell Madame
        de Villefort that they wished to leave. No entreaty, no proposition of
        increased wages, could induce them to remain; to every argument they
        replied, &ldquo;We must go, for death is in this house.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        They all left, in spite of prayers and entreaties, testifying their regret at
        leaving so good a master and mistress, and especially Mademoiselle
        Valentine, so good, so kind, and so gentle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort looked at Valentine as they said this. She was in tears, and, strange
        as it was, in spite of the emotions he felt at the sight of these tears, he looked
        also at Madame de Villefort, and it appeared to him as if a slight gloomy smile had
        passed over her thin lips, like a meteor seen passing inauspiciously
        between two clouds in a stormy sky.
