      <h2>Chapter 6. The Deputy Procureur du Roi</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n one of the
        aristocratic mansions built by Puget in the Rue du Grand Cours opposite
        the Medusa fountain, a second marriage feast was being celebrated, almost
        at the same hour with the nuptial repast given by Dantès. In this case,
        however, although the occasion of the entertainment was similar, the
        company was strikingly dissimilar. Instead of a rude mixture of sailors,
        soldiers, and those belonging to the humblest grade of life, the present
        assembly was composed of the very flower of Marseilles society,&mdash;magistrates
        who had resigned their office during the usurper&rsquo;s reign; officers
        who had deserted from the imperial army and joined forces with Condé; and
        younger members of families, brought up to hate and execrate the man whom
        five years of exile would convert into a martyr, and fifteen of
        restoration elevate to the rank of a god.
      </p>
      <p>
        The guests were still at table, and the heated and energetic conversation
        that prevailed betrayed the violent and vindictive passions that then
        agitated each dweller of the South, where unhappily, for five centuries
        religious strife had long given increased bitterness to the violence of
        party feeling.
      </p>
      <p>
        The emperor, now king of the petty Island of Elba, after having held
        sovereign sway over one-half of the world, counting as his subjects a
        small population of five or six thousand souls,&mdash;after having been
        accustomed to hear the &ldquo;<i>Vive Napoléons</i>&rdquo; of a hundred
        and twenty millions of human beings, uttered in ten different languages,&mdash;was
        looked upon here as a ruined man, separated forever from any fresh
        connection with France or claim to her throne.
      </p>
      <p>
        The magistrates freely discussed their political views; the military part
        of the company talked unreservedly of Moscow and Leipsic, while the women
        commented on the divorce of Josephine. It was not over the downfall of the
        man, but over the defeat of the Napoleonic idea, that they rejoiced, and
        in this they foresaw for themselves the bright and cheering prospect of a
        revivified political existence.
      </p>
      <p>
        An old man, decorated with the cross of Saint Louis, now rose and proposed
        the health of King Louis XVIII. It was the Marquis de Saint-Méran. This
        toast, recalling at once the patient exile of Hartwell and the
        peace-loving King of France, excited universal enthusiasm; glasses were
        elevated in the air <i>à l&rsquo;Anglaise</i>, and the ladies, snatching
        their bouquets from their fair bosoms, strewed the table with their floral
        treasures. In a word, an almost poetical fervor prevailed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the Marquise de Saint-Méran, a woman with a stern,
        forbidding eye, though still noble and distinguished in appearance,
        despite her fifty years&mdash;&ldquo;ah, these revolutionists, who have
        driven us from those very possessions they afterwards purchased for a mere
        trifle during the Reign of Terror, would be compelled to own, were they
        here, that all true devotion was on our side, since we were content to
        follow the fortunes of a falling monarch, while they, on the contrary,
        made their fortune by worshipping the rising sun; yes, yes, they could not
        help admitting that the king, for whom we sacrificed rank, wealth, and
        station was truly our &lsquo;Louis the well-beloved,&rsquo; while their
        wretched usurper has been, and ever will be, to them their evil genius,
        their &lsquo;Napoleon the accursed.&rsquo; Am I not right, Villefort?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I beg your pardon, madame. I really must pray you to excuse me, but&mdash;in
        truth&mdash;I was not attending to the conversation.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Marquise, marquise!&rdquo; interposed the old nobleman who had
        proposed the toast, &ldquo;let the young people alone; let me tell you, on
        one&rsquo;s wedding day there are more agreeable subjects of conversation
        than dry politics.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Never mind, dearest mother,&rdquo; said a young and lovely girl,
        with a profusion of light brown hair, and eyes that seemed to float in
        liquid crystal, &ldquo;&rsquo;tis all my fault for seizing upon M. de
        Villefort, so as to prevent his listening to what you said. But there&mdash;now
        take him&mdash;he is your own for as long as you like. M. Villefort, I beg
        to remind you my mother speaks to you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If the marquise will deign to repeat the words I but imperfectly
        caught, I shall be delighted to answer,&rdquo; said M. de Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Never mind, Renée,&rdquo; replied the marquise, with a look of
        tenderness that seemed out of keeping with her harsh dry features; but,
        however all other feelings may be withered in a woman&rsquo;s nature,
        there is always one bright smiling spot in the desert of her heart, and
        that is the shrine of maternal love. &ldquo;I forgive you. What I was
        saying, Villefort, was, that the Bonapartists had not our sincerity,
        enthusiasm, or devotion.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They had, however, what supplied the place of those fine qualities,&rdquo;
        replied the young man, &ldquo;and that was fanaticism. Napoleon is the
        Mahomet of the West, and is worshipped by his commonplace but ambitious
        followers, not only as a leader and lawgiver, but also as the
        personification of equality.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He!&rdquo; cried the marquise: &ldquo;Napoleon the type of
        equality! For mercy&rsquo;s sake, then, what would you call Robespierre?
        Come, come, do not strip the latter of his just rights to bestow them on
        the Corsican, who, to my mind, has usurped quite enough.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0085m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nay, madame; I would place each of these heroes on his right
        pedestal&mdash;that of Robespierre on his scaffold in the Place Louis
        Quinze; that of Napoleon on the column of the Place Vendôme. The only
        difference consists in the opposite character of the equality advocated by
        these two men; one is the equality that elevates, the other is the
        equality that degrades; one brings a king within reach of the guillotine,
        the other elevates the people to a level with the throne. Observe,&rdquo;
        said Villefort, smiling, &ldquo;I do not mean to deny that both these men
        were revolutionary scoundrels, and that the 9th Thermidor and the 4th of
        April, in the year 1814, were lucky days for France, worthy of being
        gratefully remembered by every friend to monarchy and civil order; and
        that explains how it comes to pass that, fallen, as I trust he is forever,
        Napoleon has still retained a train of parasitical satellites. Still,
        marquise, it has been so with other usurpers&mdash;Cromwell, for instance,
        who was not half so bad as Napoleon, had his partisans and advocates.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know, Villefort, that you are talking in a most dreadfully
        revolutionary strain? But I excuse it, it is impossible to expect the son
        of a Girondin to be free from a small spice of the old leaven.&rdquo; A
        deep crimson suffused the countenance of Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis true, madame,&rdquo; answered he, &ldquo;that my father
        was a Girondin, but he was not among the number of those who voted for the
        king&rsquo;s death; he was an equal sufferer with yourself during the
        Reign of Terror, and had well-nigh lost his head on the same scaffold on
        which your father perished.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied the marquise, without wincing in the slightest
        degree at the tragic remembrance thus called up; &ldquo;but bear in mind,
        if you please, that our respective parents underwent persecution and
        proscription from diametrically opposite principles; in proof of which I
        may remark, that while my family remained among the staunchest adherents
        of the exiled princes, your father lost no time in joining the new
        government; and that while the Citizen Noirtier was a Girondin, the Count
        Noirtier became a senator.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Dear mother,&rdquo; interposed Renée, &ldquo;you know very well it
        was agreed that all these disagreeable reminiscences should forever be
        laid aside.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Suffer me, also, madame,&rdquo; replied Villefort, &ldquo;to add my
        earnest request to Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran&rsquo;s, that you will
        kindly allow the veil of oblivion to cover and conceal the past. What
        avails recrimination over matters wholly past recall? For my own part, I
        have laid aside even the name of my father, and altogether disown his
        political principles. He was&mdash;nay, probably may still be&mdash;a
        Bonapartist, and is called Noirtier; I, on the contrary, am a staunch
        royalist, and style myself de Villefort. Let what may remain of
        revolutionary sap exhaust itself and die away with the old trunk, and
        condescend only to regard the young shoot which has started up at a
        distance from the parent tree, without having the power, any more than the
        wish, to separate entirely from the stock from which it sprung.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bravo, Villefort!&rdquo; cried the marquis; &ldquo;excellently well
        said! Come, now, I have hopes of obtaining what I have been for years
        endeavoring to persuade the marquise to promise; namely, a perfect amnesty
        and forgetfulness of the past.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; replied the marquise; &ldquo;let the past
        be forever forgotten. I promise you it affords <i>me</i> as little
        pleasure to revive it as it does you. All I ask is, that Villefort will be
        firm and inflexible for the future in his political principles. Remember,
        also, Villefort, that we have pledged ourselves to his majesty for your
        fealty and strict loyalty, and that at our recommendation the king
        consented to forget the past, as I do&rdquo; (and here she extended to him
        her hand)&mdash;&ldquo;as I now do at your entreaty. But bear in mind,
        that should there fall in your way anyone guilty of conspiring against the
        government, you will be so much the more bound to visit the offence with
        rigorous punishment, as it is known you belong to a suspected family.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas, madame,&rdquo; returned Villefort, &ldquo;my profession, as
        well as the times in which we live, compels me to be severe. I have
        already successfully conducted several public prosecutions, and brought
        the offenders to merited punishment. But we have not done with the thing
        yet.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0087m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you, indeed, think so?&rdquo; inquired the marquise.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am, at least, fearful of it. Napoleon, in the Island of Elba, is
        too near France, and his proximity keeps up the hopes of his partisans.
        Marseilles is filled with half-pay officers, who are daily, under one
        frivolous pretext or other, getting up quarrels with the royalists; from
        hence arise continual and fatal duels among the higher classes of persons,
        and assassinations in the lower.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have heard, perhaps,&rdquo; said the Comte de Salvieux, one of
        M. de Saint-Méran&rsquo;s oldest friends, and chamberlain to the Comte d&rsquo;Artois,
        &ldquo;that the Holy Alliance purpose removing him from thence?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; they were talking about it when we left Paris,&rdquo; said M.
        de Saint-Méran; &ldquo;and where is it decided to transfer him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To Saint Helena.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, where is that?&rdquo; asked the marquise.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;An island situated on the other side of the equator, at least two
        thousand leagues from here,&rdquo; replied the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So much the better. As Villefort observes, it is a great act of
        folly to have left such a man between Corsica, where he was born, and
        Naples, of which his brother-in-law is king, and face to face with Italy,
        the sovereignty of which he coveted for his son.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; said Villefort, &ldquo;there are the treaties
        of 1814, and we cannot molest Napoleon without breaking those compacts.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, well, we shall find some way out of it,&rdquo; responded M. de
        Salvieux. &ldquo;There wasn&rsquo;t any trouble over treaties when it was
        a question of shooting the poor Duc d&rsquo;Enghien.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the marquise, &ldquo;it seems probable that, by
        the aid of the Holy Alliance, we shall be rid of Napoleon; and we must
        trust to the vigilance of M. de Villefort to purify Marseilles of his
        partisans. The king is either a king or no king; if he be acknowledged as
        sovereign of France, he should be upheld in peace and tranquillity; and
        this can best be effected by employing the most inflexible agents to put
        down every attempt at conspiracy&mdash;&rsquo;tis the best and surest
        means of preventing mischief.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Unfortunately, madame,&rdquo; answered Villefort, &ldquo;the strong
        arm of the law is not called upon to interfere until the evil has taken
        place.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then all he has got to do is to endeavor to repair it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nay, madame, the law is frequently powerless to effect this; all it
        can do is to avenge the wrong done.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, M. de Villefort,&rdquo; cried a beautiful young creature,
        daughter to the Comte de Salvieux, and the cherished friend of
        Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, &ldquo;do try and get up some famous trial
        while we are at Marseilles. I never was in a law-court; I am told it is so
        very amusing!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Amusing, certainly,&rdquo; replied the young man, &ldquo;inasmuch
        as, instead of shedding tears as at the fictitious tale of woe produced at
        a theatre, you behold in a law-court a case of real and genuine distress&mdash;a
        drama of life. The prisoner whom you there see pale, agitated, and
        alarmed, instead of&mdash;as is the case when a curtain falls on a tragedy&mdash;going
        home to sup peacefully with his family, and then retiring to rest, that he
        may recommence his mimic woes on the morrow,&mdash;is removed from your
        sight merely to be reconducted to his prison and delivered up to the
        executioner. I leave you to judge how far your nerves are calculated to
        bear you through such a scene. Of this, however, be assured, that should
        any favorable opportunity present itself, I will not fail to offer you the
        choice of being present.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;For shame, M. de Villefort!&rdquo; said Renée, becoming quite pale;
        &ldquo;don&rsquo;t you see how you are frightening us?&mdash;and yet you
        laugh.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What would you have? &rsquo;Tis like a duel. I have already
        recorded sentence of death, five or six times, against the movers of
        political conspiracies, and who can say how many daggers may be ready
        sharpened, and only waiting a favorable opportunity to be buried in my
        heart?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Gracious heavens, M. de Villefort,&rdquo; said Renée, becoming more
        and more terrified; &ldquo;you surely are not in earnest.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed I am,&rdquo; replied the young magistrate with a smile;
        &ldquo;and in the interesting trial that young lady is anxious to witness,
        the case would only be still more aggravated. Suppose, for instance, the
        prisoner, as is more than probable, to have served under Napoleon&mdash;well,
        can you expect for an instant, that one accustomed, at the word of his
        commander, to rush fearlessly on the very bayonets of his foe, will
        scruple more to drive a stiletto into the heart of one he knows to be his
        personal enemy, than to slaughter his fellow-creatures, merely because
        bidden to do so by one he is bound to obey? Besides, one requires the
        excitement of being hateful in the eyes of the accused, in order to lash
        one&rsquo;s self into a state of sufficient vehemence and power. I would
        not choose to see the man against whom I pleaded smile, as though in
        mockery of my words. No; my pride is to see the accused pale, agitated,
        and as though beaten out of all composure by the fire of my eloquence.&rdquo;
        Renée uttered a smothered exclamation.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; cried one of the guests; &ldquo;that is what I call
        talking to some purpose.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Just the person we require at a time like the present,&rdquo; said
        a second.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What a splendid business that last case of yours was, my dear
        Villefort!&rdquo; remarked a third; &ldquo;I mean the trial of the man for
        murdering his father. Upon my word, you killed him ere the executioner had
        laid his hand upon him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, as for parricides, and such dreadful people as that,&rdquo;
        interposed Renée, &ldquo;it matters very little what is done to them; but
        as regards poor unfortunate creatures whose only crime consists in having
        mixed themselves up in political intrigues&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, that is the very worst offence they could possibly commit;
        for, don&rsquo;t you see, Renée, the king is the father of his people, and
        he who shall plot or contrive aught against the life and safety of the
        parent of thirty-two millions of souls, is a parricide upon a fearfully
        great scale?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know anything about that,&rdquo; replied Renée;
        &ldquo;but, M. de Villefort, you have promised me&mdash;have you not?&mdash;always
        to show mercy to those I plead for.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Make yourself quite easy on that point,&rdquo; answered Villefort,
        with one of his sweetest smiles; &ldquo;you and I will always consult upon
        our verdicts.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My love,&rdquo; said the marquise, &ldquo;attend to your doves,
        your lap-dogs, and embroidery, but do not meddle with what you do not
        understand. Nowadays the military profession is in abeyance and the
        magisterial robe is the badge of honor. There is a wise Latin proverb that
        is very much in point.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Cedant arma togæ</i>,&rdquo; said Villefort with a bow.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I cannot speak Latin,&rdquo; responded the marquise.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Renée, &ldquo;I cannot help regretting you had
        not chosen some other profession than your own&mdash;a physician, for
        instance. Do you know I always felt a shudder at the idea of even a <i>destroying</i>
        angel?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Dear, good Renée,&rdquo; whispered Villefort, as he gazed with
        unutterable tenderness on the lovely speaker.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us hope, my child,&rdquo; cried the marquis, &ldquo;that M. de
        Villefort may prove the moral and political physician of this province; if
        so, he will have achieved a noble work.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And one which will go far to efface the recollection of his father&rsquo;s
        conduct,&rdquo; added the incorrigible marquise.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; replied Villefort, with a mournful smile, &ldquo;I
        have already had the honor to observe that my father has&mdash;at least, I
        hope so&mdash;abjured his past errors, and that he is, at the present
        moment, a firm and zealous friend to religion and order&mdash;a better
        royalist, possibly, than his son; for he has to atone for past
        dereliction, while I have no other impulse than warm, decided preference
        and conviction.&rdquo; Having made this well-turned speech, Villefort
        looked carefully around to mark the effect of his oratory, much as he
        would have done had he been addressing the bench in open court.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know, my dear Villefort,&rdquo; cried the Comte de Salvieux,
        &ldquo;that is exactly what I myself said the other day at the Tuileries,
        when questioned by his majesty&rsquo;s principal chamberlain touching the
        singularity of an alliance between the son of a Girondin and the daughter
        of an officer of the Duc de Condé; and I assure you he seemed fully to
        comprehend that this mode of reconciling political differences was based
        upon sound and excellent principles. Then the king, who, without our
        suspecting it, had overheard our conversation, interrupted us by saying,
        &lsquo;Villefort&rsquo;&mdash;observe that the king did not pronounce the
        word Noirtier, but, on the contrary, placed considerable emphasis on that
        of Villefort&mdash;&lsquo;Villefort,&rsquo; said his majesty, &lsquo;is a
        young man of great judgment and discretion, who will be sure to make a
        figure in his profession; I like him much, and it gave me great pleasure
        to hear that he was about to become the son-in-law of the Marquis and
        Marquise de Saint-Méran. I should myself have recommended the match, had
        not the noble marquis anticipated my wishes by requesting my consent to
        it.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is it possible the king could have condescended so far as to
        express himself so favorably of me?&rdquo; asked the enraptured Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I give you his very words; and if the marquis chooses to be candid,
        he will confess that they perfectly agree with what his majesty said to
        him, when he went six months ago to consult him upon the subject of your
        espousing his daughter.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0091m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is true,&rdquo; answered the marquis.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How much do I owe this gracious prince! What is there I would not
        do to evince my earnest gratitude!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is right,&rdquo; cried the marquise. &ldquo;I love to see you
        thus. Now, then, were a conspirator to fall into your hands, he would be
        most welcome.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;For my part, dear mother,&rdquo; interposed Renée, &ldquo;I trust
        your wishes will not prosper, and that Providence will only permit petty
        offenders, poor debtors, and miserable cheats to fall into M. de Villefort&rsquo;s
        hands,&mdash;then I shall be contented.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Just the same as though you prayed that a physician might only be
        called upon to prescribe for headaches, measles, and the stings of wasps,
        or any other slight affection of the epidermis. If you wish to see me the
        king&rsquo;s attorney, you must desire for me some of those violent and
        dangerous diseases from the cure of which so much honor redounds to the
        physician.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, and as though the utterance of Villefort&rsquo;s wish had
        sufficed to effect its accomplishment, a servant entered the room, and
        whispered a few words in his ear. Villefort immediately rose from table
        and quitted the room upon the plea of urgent business; he soon, however,
        returned, his whole face beaming with delight. Renée regarded him with
        fond affection; and certainly his handsome features, lit up as they then
        were with more than usual fire and animation, seemed formed to excite the
        innocent admiration with which she gazed on her graceful and intelligent
        lover.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You were wishing just now,&rdquo; said Villefort, addressing her,
        &ldquo;that I were a doctor instead of a lawyer. Well, I at least resemble
        the disciples of Esculapius in one thing [people spoke in this style in
        1815], that of not being able to call a day my own, not even that of my
        betrothal.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And wherefore were you called away just now?&rdquo; asked
        Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran, with an air of deep interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;For a very serious matter, which bids fair to make work for the
        executioner.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How dreadful!&rdquo; exclaimed Renée, turning pale.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; burst simultaneously from all who were near
        enough to the magistrate to hear his words.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, if my information prove correct, a sort of Bonapartist
        conspiracy has just been discovered.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Can I believe my ears?&rdquo; cried the marquise.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will read you the letter containing the accusation, at least,&rdquo;
        said Villefort:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;The king&rsquo;s attorney is informed by a friend to the
        throne and the religious institutions of his country, that one named
        Edmond Dantès, mate of the ship <i>Pharaon</i>, this day arrived from
        Smyrna, after having touched at Naples and Porto-Ferrajo, has been the
        bearer of a letter from Murat to the usurper, and again taken charge of
        another letter from the usurper to the Bonapartist club in Paris. Ample
        corroboration of this statement may be obtained by arresting the
        above-mentioned Edmond Dantès, who either carries the letter for Paris
        about with him, or has it at his father&rsquo;s abode. Should it not be
        found in the possession of father or son, then it will assuredly be
        discovered in the cabin belonging to the said Dantès on board the <i>Pharaon</i>.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Renée, &ldquo;this letter, which, after all, is
        but an anonymous scrawl, is not even addressed to you, but to the king&rsquo;s
        attorney.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0093m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;True; but that gentleman being absent, his secretary, by his
        orders, opened his letters; thinking this one of importance, he sent for
        me, but not finding me, took upon himself to give the necessary orders for
        arresting the accused party.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then the guilty person is absolutely in custody?&rdquo; said the
        marquise.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nay, dear mother, say the accused person. You know we cannot yet
        pronounce him guilty.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is in safe custody,&rdquo; answered Villefort; &ldquo;and rely
        upon it, if the letter is found, he will not be likely to be trusted
        abroad again, unless he goes forth under the especial protection of the
        headsman.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And where is the unfortunate being?&rdquo; asked Renée.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is at my house.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, come, my friend,&rdquo; interrupted the marquise, &ldquo;do
        not neglect your duty to linger with us. You are the king&rsquo;s servant,
        and must go wherever that service calls you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, Villefort!&rdquo; cried Renée, clasping her hands, and looking
        towards her lover with piteous earnestness, &ldquo;be merciful on this the
        day of our betrothal.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The young man passed round to the side of the table where the fair pleader
        sat, and leaning over her chair said tenderly:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To give you pleasure, my sweet Renée, I promise to show all the
        lenity in my power; but if the charges brought against this Bonapartist
        hero prove correct, why, then, you really must give me leave to order his
        head to be cut off.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Renée shuddered at the word <i>cut</i>, for the growth in question had a head.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Never mind that foolish girl, Villefort,&rdquo; said the marquise.
        &ldquo;She will soon get over these things.&rdquo; So saying, Madame de
        Saint-Méran extended her dry bony hand to Villefort, who, while imprinting
        a son-in-law&rsquo;s respectful salute on it, looked at Renée, as much as
        to say, &ldquo;I must try and fancy &rsquo;tis your dear hand I kiss, as
        it should have been.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;These are mournful auspices to accompany a betrothal,&rdquo; sighed
        poor Renée.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Upon my word, child!&rdquo; exclaimed the angry marquise, &ldquo;your
        folly exceeds all bounds. I should be glad to know what connection there
        can possibly be between your sickly sentimentality and the affairs of the
        state!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, mother!&rdquo; murmured Renée.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nay, madame, I pray you pardon this little traitor. I promise you
        that to make up for her want of loyalty, I will be most inflexibly severe;&rdquo;
        then casting an expressive glance at his betrothed, which seemed to say,
        &ldquo;Fear not, for your dear sake my justice shall be tempered with
        mercy,&rdquo; and receiving a sweet and approving smile in return,
        Villefort departed with paradise in his heart.
