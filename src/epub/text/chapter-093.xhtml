      <h2>Chapter 93. Valentine</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e may easily
        conceive where Morrel&rsquo;s appointment was. On leaving Monte Cristo he
        walked slowly towards Villefort&rsquo;s; we say slowly, for Morrel had
        more than half an hour to spare to go five hundred steps, but he had
        hastened to take leave of Monte Cristo because he wished to be alone with
        his thoughts. He knew his time well&mdash;the hour when Valentine was
        giving Noirtier his breakfast, and was sure not to be disturbed in the
        performance of this pious duty. Noirtier and Valentine had given him leave
        to go twice a week, and he was now availing himself of that permission.
      </p>
      <p>
        He arrived; Valentine was expecting him. Uneasy and almost crazed, she
        seized his hand and led him to her grandfather. This uneasiness, amounting
        almost to frenzy, arose from the report Morcerf&rsquo;s adventure had made
        in the world, for the affair at the Opera was generally known. No one at
        Villefort&rsquo;s doubted that a duel would ensue from it. Valentine, with
        her woman&rsquo;s instinct, guessed that Morrel would be Monte Cristo&rsquo;s
        second, and from the young man&rsquo;s well-known courage and his great
        affection for the count, she feared that he would not content himself with
        the passive part assigned to him. We may easily understand how eagerly the
        particulars were asked for, given, and received; and Morrel could read an
        indescribable joy in the eyes of his beloved, when she knew that the
        termination of this affair was as happy as it was unexpected.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said Valentine, motioning to Morrel to sit down near
        her grandfather, while she took her seat on his footstool,&mdash;&ldquo;now
        let us talk about our own affairs. You know, Maximilian, grandpapa once
        thought of leaving this house, and taking an apartment away from M. de
        Villefort&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Maximilian, &ldquo;I recollect the project, of
        which I highly approved.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Valentine, &ldquo;you may approve again, for
        grandpapa is again thinking of it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bravo,&rdquo; said Maximilian.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40272m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And do you know,&rdquo; said Valentine, &ldquo;what reason
        grandpapa gives for leaving this house.&rdquo; Noirtier looked at
        Valentine to impose silence, but she did not notice him; her looks, her
        eyes, her smile, were all for Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, whatever may be M. Noirtier&rsquo;s reason,&rdquo; answered
        Morrel, &ldquo;I can readily believe it to be a good one.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;An excellent one,&rdquo; said Valentine. &ldquo;He pretends the air
        of the Faubourg Saint-Honor√© is not good for me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; said Morrel; &ldquo;in that M. Noirtier may be
        right; you have not seemed to be well for the last fortnight.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not very,&rdquo; said Valentine. &ldquo;And grandpapa has become my
        physician, and I have the greatest confidence in him, because he knows
        everything.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you then really suffer?&rdquo; asked Morrel quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, it must not be called suffering; I feel a general uneasiness,
        that is all. I have lost my appetite, and my stomach feels as if it were
        struggling to get accustomed to something.&rdquo; Noirtier did not lose a
        word of what Valentine said.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what treatment do you adopt for this singular complaint?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A very simple one,&rdquo; said Valentine. &ldquo;I swallow every
        morning a spoonful of the mixture prepared for my grandfather. When I say
        one spoonful, I began by one&mdash;now I take four. Grandpapa says it is a
        panacea.&rdquo; Valentine smiled, but it was evident that she suffered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maximilian, in his devotedness, gazed silently at her. She was very
        beautiful, but her usual pallor had increased; her eyes were more
        brilliant than ever, and her hands, which were generally white like
        mother-of-pearl, now more resembled wax, to which time was adding a
        yellowish hue.
      </p>
      <p>
        From Valentine the young man looked towards Noirtier. The latter watched with
        strange and deep interest the young girl, absorbed by her affection, and he also,
        like Morrel, followed those traces of inward suffering which was so little
        perceptible to a common observer that they escaped the notice of everyone but
        the grandfather and the lover.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Morrel, &ldquo;I thought this mixture, of which
        you now take four spoonfuls, was prepared for M. Noirtier?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I know it is very bitter,&rdquo; said Valentine; &ldquo;so bitter,
        that all I drink afterwards appears to have the same taste.&rdquo;
        Noirtier looked inquiringly at his granddaughter. &ldquo;Yes, grandpapa,&rdquo;
        said Valentine; &ldquo;it is so. Just now, before I came down to you, I
        drank a glass of sugared water; I left half, because it seemed so bitter.&rdquo;
        Noirtier turned pale, and made a sign that he wished to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine rose to fetch the dictionary. Noirtier watched her with evident anguish.
        In fact, the blood was rushing to the young girl&rsquo;s head already, her
        cheeks were becoming red.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried she, without losing any of her cheerfulness, &ldquo;this
        is singular! I can&rsquo;t see! Did the sun shine in my eyes?&rdquo; And she
        leaned against the window.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The sun is not shining,&rdquo; said Morrel, more alarmed by
        Noirtier&rsquo;s expression than by Valentine&rsquo;s indisposition. He
        ran towards her. The young girl smiled.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Cheer up,&rdquo; said she to Noirtier. &ldquo;Do not be alarmed, Maximilian;
        it is nothing, and has already passed away. But listen! Do I not hear a carriage
        in the courtyard?&rdquo; She opened Noirtier&rsquo;s door, ran to a window in the
        passage, and returned hastily. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it is
        Madame Danglars and her daughter, who have come to call on us. Good-bye;&mdash;I
        must run away, for they would send here for me, or, rather, farewell till
        I see you again. Stay with grandpapa, Maximilian; I promise you not to
        persuade them to stay.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40274m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        Morrel watched her as she left the room; he heard her ascend the little
        staircase which led both to Madame de Villefort&rsquo;s apartments and to
        hers. As soon as she was gone, Noirtier made a sign to Morrel to take the
        dictionary. Morrel obeyed; guided by Valentine, he had learned how to
        understand the old man quickly. Accustomed, however, as he was to the
        work, he had to repeat most of the letters of the alphabet and to find
        every word in the dictionary, so that it was ten minutes before the
        thought of the old man was translated by these words,
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Fetch the glass of water and the decanter from Valentine&rsquo;s room.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel rang immediately for the servant who had taken Barrois&rsquo;s
        situation, and in Noirtier&rsquo;s name gave that order. The servant soon
        returned. The decanter and the glass were completely empty. Noirtier made
        a sign that he wished to speak.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why are the glass and decanter empty?&rdquo; asked he; &ldquo;Valentine
        said she only drank half the glassful.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The translation of this new question occupied another five minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; said the servant, &ldquo;but the housemaid is in
        Mademoiselle Valentine&rsquo;s room: perhaps she has emptied them.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ask her,&rdquo; said Morrel, translating Noirtier&rsquo;s thought
        this time by his look. The servant went out, but returned almost
        immediately. &ldquo;Mademoiselle Valentine passed through the room to go
        to Madame de Villefort&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;and in passing, as
        she was thirsty, she drank what remained in the glass; as for the
        decanter, Master Edward had emptied that to make a pond for his ducks.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Noirtier raised his eyes to heaven, as a gambler does who stakes his all
        on one stroke. From that moment the old man&rsquo;s eyes were fixed on the
        door, and did not quit it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was indeed Madame Danglars and her daughter whom Valentine had seen;
        they had been ushered into Madame de Villefort&rsquo;s room, who had said
        she would receive them there. That is why Valentine passed through her
        room, which was on a level with Valentine&rsquo;s, and only separated from
        it by Edward&rsquo;s. The two ladies entered the drawing-room with that
        sort of official stiffness which preludes a formal communication. Among
        worldly people manner is contagious. Madame de Villefort received them
        with equal solemnity. Valentine entered at this moment, and the
        formalities were resumed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; said the baroness, while the two young people were
        shaking hands, &ldquo;I and Eug√©nie are come to be the first to announce to you
        the approaching marriage of my daughter with Prince Cavalcanti.&rdquo; Danglars
        kept up the title of prince. The popular banker found that it answered better than
        count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Allow me to present you my sincere congratulations,&rdquo; replied
        Madame de Villefort. &ldquo;Prince Cavalcanti appears to be a young man of
        rare qualities.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40276m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said the baroness, smiling; &ldquo;speaking to you
        as a friend I can say that the prince does not yet appear all he will be.
        He has about him a little of that foreign manner by which French persons
        recognize, at first sight, the Italian or German nobleman. Besides, he
        gives evidence of great kindness of disposition, much keenness of wit, and
        as to suitability, M. Danglars assures me that his fortune is majestic&mdash;that
        is his word.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And then,&rdquo; said Eug√©nie, while turning over the leaves of
        Madame de Villefort&rsquo;s album, &ldquo;add that you have taken a great
        fancy to the young man.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And,&rdquo; said Madame de Villefort, &ldquo;I need not ask you if
        you share that fancy.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I?&rdquo; replied Eug√©nie with her usual candor. &ldquo;Oh, not the
        least in the world, madame! My wish was not to confine myself to domestic
        cares, or the caprices of any man, but to be an artist, and consequently
        free in heart, in person, and in thought.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Eug√©nie pronounced these words with so firm a tone that the color mounted to
        Valentine&rsquo;s cheeks. The timid girl could not understand that vigorous
        nature which appeared to have none of the timidities of woman.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At any rate,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;since I am to be married
        whether I will or not, I ought to be thankful to Providence for having
        released me from my engagement with M. Albert de Morcerf, or I should this
        day have been the wife of a dishonored man.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; said the baroness, with that strange simplicity
        sometimes met with among fashionable ladies, and of which plebeian
        intercourse can never entirely deprive them,&mdash;&ldquo;it is very true
        that had not the Morcerfs hesitated, my daughter would have married
        Monsieur Albert. The general depended much on it; he even came to force M.
        Danglars. We have had a narrow escape.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Valentine, timidly, &ldquo;does all the father&rsquo;s
        shame revert upon the son? Monsieur Albert appears to me quite innocent of
        the treason charged against the general.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said the implacable young girl, &ldquo;Monsieur
        Albert claims and well deserves his share. It appears that after having
        challenged M. de Monte Cristo at the Opera yesterday, he apologized on the
        ground today.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Impossible,&rdquo; said Madame de Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, my dear friend,&rdquo; said Madame Danglars, with the same
        simplicity we before noticed, &ldquo;it is a fact. I heard it from M.
        Debray, who was present at the explanation.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine also knew the truth, but she did not answer. A single word had reminded
        her that Morrel was expecting her in M. Noirtier&rsquo;s room. Deeply engaged with
        a sort of inward contemplation, Valentine had ceased for a moment to join in the
        conversation. She would, indeed, have found it impossible to repeat what
        had been said the last few minutes, when suddenly Madame Danglars&rsquo;
        hand, pressed on her arm, aroused her from her lethargy.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said she, starting at Madame Danglars&rsquo;
        touch as she would have done from an electric shock.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is, my dear Valentine,&rdquo; said the baroness, &ldquo;that you
        are, doubtless, suffering.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40280m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I?&rdquo; said the young girl, passing her hand across her burning
        forehead.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, look at yourself in that glass; you have turned pale and then
        red successively, three or four times in one minute.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; cried Eug√©nie, &ldquo;you are very pale!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, do not be alarmed; I have been so for many days.&rdquo; Artless
        as she was, the young girl knew that this was an opportunity to leave, and
        besides, Madame de Villefort came to her assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Retire, Valentine,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;you are really suffering,
        and these ladies will excuse you; drink a glass of pure water, it will restore
        you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine kissed Eug√©nie, bowed to Madame Danglars, who had already risen
        to take her leave, and went out.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That poor child,&rdquo; said Madame de Villefort when Valentine was gone,
        &ldquo;she makes me very uneasy, and I should not be astonished if she had some
        serious illness.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, Valentine, in a sort of excitement which she could not quite
        understand, had crossed Edward&rsquo;s room without noticing some trick of
        the child, and through her own had reached the little staircase.
      </p>
      <p>
        She was within three steps of the bottom; she already heard Morrel&rsquo;s voice,
        when suddenly a cloud passed over her eyes, her stiffened foot missed the
        step, her hands had no power to hold the baluster, and falling against the
        wall she lost her balance wholly and toppled to the floor. Morrel bounded
        to the door, opened it, and found Valentine stretched out at the bottom of
        the stairs. Quick as a flash, he raised her in his arms and placed her in
        a chair. Valentine opened her eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, what a clumsy thing I am,&rdquo; said she with feverish
        volubility; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know my way. I forgot there were three
        more steps before the landing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have hurt yourself, perhaps,&rdquo; said Morrel. &ldquo;What
        can I do for you, Valentine?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Valentine looked around her; she saw the deepest terror depicted in
        Noirtier&rsquo;s eyes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, dear grandpapa,&rdquo; said she, endeavoring to smile;
        &ldquo;it is nothing&mdash;it is nothing; I was giddy, that is all.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Another attack of giddiness,&rdquo; said Morrel, clasping his
        hands. &ldquo;Oh, attend to it, Valentine, I entreat you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But no,&rdquo; said Valentine,&mdash;&ldquo;no, I tell you it is
        all past, and it was nothing. Now, let me tell you some news; Eug√©nie is
        to be married in a week, and in three days there is to be a grand feast, a
        betrothal festival. We are all invited, my father, Madame de Villefort,
        and I&mdash;at least, I understood it so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;When will it be our turn to think of these things? Oh, Valentine,
        you who have so much influence over your grandpapa, try to make him
        answer&mdash;Soon.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And do you,&rdquo; said Valentine, &ldquo;depend on me to stimulate
        the tardiness and arouse the memory of grandpapa?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; cried Morrel, &ldquo;make haste. So long as you are not
        mine, Valentine, I shall always think I may lose you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Valentine with a convulsive movement, &ldquo;oh,
        indeed, Maximilian, you are too timid for an officer, for a soldier who,
        they say, never knows fear. Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        She burst into a forced and melancholy laugh, her arms stiffened and
        twisted, her head fell back on her chair, and she remained motionless. The
        cry of terror which was stopped on Noirtier&rsquo;s lips, seemed to start
        from his eyes. Morrel understood it; he knew he must call assistance. The
        young man rang the bell violently; the housemaid who had been in
        Mademoiselle Valentine&rsquo;s room, and the servant who had replaced
        Barrois, ran in at the same moment. Valentine was so pale, so cold, so
        inanimate that without listening to what was said to them they were seized
        with the fear which pervaded that house, and they flew into the passage
        crying for help. Madame Danglars and Eug√©nie were going out at that
        moment; they heard the cause of the disturbance.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I told you so!&rdquo; exclaimed Madame de Villefort. &ldquo;Poor
        child!&rdquo;
