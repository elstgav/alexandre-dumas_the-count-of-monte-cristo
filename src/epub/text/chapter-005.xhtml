      <h2>Chapter 5. The Marriage Feast</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he morning&rsquo;s
        sun rose clear and resplendent, touching the foamy waves into a network of
        ruby-tinted light.
      </p>
      <p>
        The feast had been made ready on the second floor at La Réserve, with
        whose arbor the reader is already familiar. The apartment destined for the
        purpose was spacious and lighted by a number of windows, over each of
        which was written in golden letters for some inexplicable reason the name
        of one of the principal cities of France; beneath these windows a wooden
        balcony extended the entire length of the house. And although the
        entertainment was fixed for twelve o&rsquo;clock, an hour previous to that
        time the balcony was filled with impatient and expectant guests,
        consisting of the favored part of the crew of the <i>Pharaon</i>, and
        other personal friends of the bridegroom, the whole of whom had arrayed
        themselves in their choicest costumes, in order to do greater honor to the
        occasion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the <i>Pharaon</i>
        had promised to attend the nuptial feast; but all seemed unanimous in
        doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding condescension could
        possibly be intended.
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars, however, who now made his appearance, accompanied by Caderousse,
        effectually confirmed the report, stating that he had recently conversed
        with M. Morrel, who had himself assured him of his intention to dine at La
        Réserve.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, a moment later M. Morrel appeared and was saluted with an
        enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the <i>Pharaon</i>, who
        hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man whose
        wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first in
        command of the ship; and as Dantès was universally beloved on board his
        vessel, the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at finding
        that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly coincided with
        their own.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the entrance of M. Morrel, Danglars and Caderousse were despatched in
        search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the arrival
        of the important personage whose coming had created such a lively
        sensation, and to beseech him to make haste.
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars and Caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed; but ere
        they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them,
        composed of the betrothed pair, a party of young girls in attendance on
        the bride, by whose side walked Dantès&rsquo; father; the whole brought up
        by Fernand, whose lips wore their usual sinister smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither Mercédès nor Edmond observed the strange expression of his
        countenance; they were so happy that they were conscious only of the
        sunshine and the presence of each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having acquitted themselves of their errand, and exchanged a hearty shake
        of the hand with Edmond, Danglars and Caderousse took their places beside
        Fernand and old Dantès,&mdash;the latter of whom attracted universal notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk,
        trimmed with steel buttons, beautifully cut and polished. His thin but
        wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked stockings,
        evidently of English manufacture, while from his three-cornered hat
        depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons. Thus he came
        along, supporting himself on a curiously carved stick, his aged
        countenance lit up with happiness, looking for all the world like one of
        the aged dandies of 1796, parading the newly opened gardens of the
        Luxembourg and Tuileries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beside him glided Caderousse, whose desire to
        partake of the good things provided for the wedding party had induced him
        to become reconciled to the Dantès, father and son, although there still
        lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the events of
        the preceding night; just as the brain retains on waking in the morning
        the dim and misty outline of a dream.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0065m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        As Danglars approached the disappointed lover, he cast on him a look of
        deep meaning, while Fernand, as he slowly paced behind the happy pair, who
        seemed, in their own unmixed content, to have entirely forgotten that such
        a being as himself existed, was pale and abstracted; occasionally,
        however, a deep flush would overspread his countenance, and a nervous
        contraction distort his features, while, with an agitated and restless
        gaze, he would glance in the direction of Marseilles, like one who either
        anticipated or foresaw some great and important event.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dantès himself was simply, but becomingly, clad in the dress peculiar to
        the merchant service&mdash;a costume somewhat between a military and a
        civil garb; and with his fine countenance, radiant with joy and happiness,
        a more perfect specimen of manly beauty could scarcely be imagined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lovely as the Greek girls of Cyprus or Chios, Mercédès boasted the same
        bright flashing eyes of jet, and ripe, round, coral lips. She moved with
        the light, free step of an Arlesienne or an Andalusian. One more practiced
        in the arts of great cities would have hid her blushes beneath a veil, or,
        at least, have cast down her thickly fringed lashes, so as to have
        concealed the liquid lustre of her animated eyes; but, on the contrary,
        the delighted girl looked around her with a smile that seemed to say:
        &ldquo;If you are my friends, rejoice with me, for I am very happy.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as the bridal party came in sight of La Réserve, M. Morrel
        descended and came forth to meet it, followed by the soldiers and sailors
        there assembled, to whom he had repeated the promise already given, that
        Dantès should be the successor to the late Captain Leclere. Edmond, at the
        approach of his patron, respectfully placed the arm of his affianced bride
        within that of M. Morrel, who, forthwith conducting her up the flight of
        wooden steps leading to the chamber in which the feast was prepared, was
        gayly followed by the guests, beneath whose heavy tread the slight
        structure creaked and groaned for the space of several minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Father,&rdquo; said Mercédès, stopping when she had reached the
        centre of the table, &ldquo;sit, I pray you, on my right hand; on my left
        I will place him who has ever been as a brother to me,&rdquo; pointing
        with a soft and gentle smile to Fernand; but her words and look seemed to
        inflict the direst torture on him, for his lips became ghastly pale, and
        even beneath the dark hue of his complexion the blood might be seen
        retreating as though some sudden pang drove it back to the heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this time, Dantès, at the opposite side of the table, had been
        occupied in similarly placing his most honored guests. M. Morrel was
        seated at his right hand, Danglars at his left; while, at a sign from
        Edmond, the rest of the company ranged themselves as they found it most
        agreeable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then they began to pass around the dusky, piquant, Arlesian sausages, and
        lobsters in their dazzling red cuirasses, prawns of large size and
        brilliant color, the echinus with its prickly outside and dainty morsel
        within, the clovis, esteemed by the epicures of the South as more than
        rivalling the exquisite flavor of the oyster, North. All the delicacies,
        in fact, that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach, and
        styled by the grateful fishermen &ldquo;fruits of the sea.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A pretty silence truly!&rdquo; said the old father of the
        bridegroom, as he carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and
        brightness of the topaz, and which had just been placed before Mercédès
        herself. &ldquo;Now, would anybody think that this room contained a happy,
        merry party, who desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours
        away?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; sighed Caderousse, &ldquo;a man cannot always feel happy
        because he is about to be married.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The truth is,&rdquo; replied Dantès, &ldquo;that I am too happy for
        noisy mirth; if that is what you meant by your observation, my worthy
        friend, you are right; joy takes a strange effect at times, it seems to
        oppress us almost the same as sorrow.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars looked towards Fernand, whose excitable nature received and
        betrayed each fresh impression.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, what ails you?&rdquo; asked he of Edmond. &ldquo;Do you fear
        any approaching evil? I should say that you were the happiest man alive at
        this instant.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And that is the very thing that alarms me,&rdquo; returned Dantès.
        &ldquo;Man does not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so
        unmixed; happiness is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our
        childhood, where fierce, fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach;
        and monsters of all shapes and kinds, requiring to be overcome ere victory
        is ours. I own that I am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an
        honor of which I feel myself unworthy&mdash;that of being the husband of
        Mercédès.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nay, nay!&rdquo; cried Caderousse, smiling, &ldquo;you have not
        attained that honor yet. Mercédès is not yet your wife. Just assume the
        tone and manner of a husband, and see how she will remind you that your
        hour is not yet come!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The bride blushed, while Fernand, restless and uneasy, seemed to start at
        every fresh sound, and from time to time wiped away the large drops of
        perspiration that gathered on his brow.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, never mind that, neighbor Caderousse; it is not worthwhile to
        contradict me for such a trifle as that. &rsquo;Tis true that Mercédès is
        not actually my wife; but,&rdquo; added he, drawing out his watch, &ldquo;in
        an hour and a half she will be.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        A general exclamation of surprise ran round the table, with the exception
        of the elder Dantès, whose laugh displayed the still perfect beauty of his
        large white teeth. Mercédès looked pleased and gratified, while Fernand
        grasped the handle of his knife with a convulsive clutch.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In an hour?&rdquo; inquired Danglars, turning pale. &ldquo;How is
        that, my friend?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, thus it is,&rdquo; replied Dantès. &ldquo;Thanks to the
        influence of M. Morrel, to whom, next to my father, I owe every blessing I
        enjoy, every difficulty has been removed. We have purchased permission to
        waive the usual delay; and at half-past two o&rsquo;clock the Mayor of
        Marseilles will be waiting for us at the city hall. Now, as a quarter-past
        one has already struck, I do not consider I have asserted too much in
        saying, that, in another hour and thirty minutes Mercédès will have become
        Madame Dantès.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0069m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        Fernand closed his eyes, a burning sensation passed across his brow, and
        he was compelled to support himself by the table to prevent his falling
        from his chair; but in spite of all his efforts, he could not refrain from
        uttering a deep groan, which, however, was lost amid the noisy
        felicitations of the company.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; cried the old man, &ldquo;you make short work
        of this kind of affair. Arrived here only yesterday morning, and married
        today at three o&rsquo;clock! Commend me to a sailor for going the quick
        way to work!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; asked Danglars, in a timid tone, &ldquo;how did you
        manage about the other formalities&mdash;the contract&mdash;the
        settlement?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The contract,&rdquo; answered Dantès, laughingly, &ldquo;it didn&rsquo;t
        take long to fix that. Mercédès has no fortune; I have none to settle on
        her. So, you see, our papers were quickly written out, and certainly do
        not come very expensive.&rdquo; This joke elicited a fresh burst of
        applause.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So that what we presumed to be merely the betrothal feast turns out
        to be the actual wedding dinner!&rdquo; said Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; answered Dantès; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t imagine I am
        going to put you off in that shabby manner. Tomorrow morning I start for
        Paris; four days to go, and the same to return, with one day to discharge
        the commission entrusted to me, is all the time I shall be absent. I shall
        be back here by the first of March, and on the second I give my real
        marriage feast.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        This prospect of fresh festivity redoubled the hilarity of the guests to
        such a degree, that the elder Dantès, who, at the commencement of the
        repast, had commented upon the silence that prevailed, now found it
        difficult, amid the general din of voices, to obtain a moment&rsquo;s
        tranquillity in which to drink to the health and prosperity of the bride
        and bridegroom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dantès, perceiving the affectionate eagerness of his father, responded by
        a look of grateful pleasure; while Mercédès glanced at the clock and made
        an expressive gesture to Edmond.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around the table reigned that noisy hilarity which usually prevails at
        such a time among people sufficiently free from the demands of social
        position not to feel the trammels of etiquette. Such as at the
        commencement of the repast had not been able to seat themselves according
        to their inclination rose unceremoniously, and sought out more agreeable
        companions. Everybody talked at once, without waiting for a reply and each
        one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fernand&rsquo;s paleness appeared to have communicated itself to Danglars.
        As for Fernand himself, he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the
        damned; unable to rest, he was among the first to quit the table, and, as
        though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such deafening
        sounds, he continued, in utter silence, to pace the farther end of the
        salon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Caderousse approached him just as Danglars, whom Fernand seemed most
        anxious to avoid, had joined him in a corner of the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said Caderousse, from whose mind the friendly
        treatment of Dantès, united with the effect of the excellent wine he had
        partaken of, had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at Dantès&rsquo;
        good fortune,&mdash;&ldquo;upon my word, Dantès is a downright good
        fellow, and when I see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so
        soon to be. I cannot help thinking it would have been a great pity to have
        served him that trick you were planning yesterday.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, there was no harm meant,&rdquo; answered Danglars; &ldquo;at
        first I certainly did feel somewhat uneasy as to what Fernand might be
        tempted to do; but when I saw how completely he had mastered his feelings,
        even so far as to become one of his rival&rsquo;s attendants, I knew there
        was no further cause for apprehension.&rdquo; Caderousse looked full at
        Fernand&mdash;he was ghastly pale.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; continued Danglars, &ldquo;the sacrifice was no
        trifling one, when the beauty of the bride is concerned. Upon my soul,
        that future captain of mine is a lucky dog! Gad! I only wish he would let
        me take his place.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall we not set forth?&rdquo; asked the sweet, silvery voice of
        Mercédès; &ldquo;two o&rsquo;clock has just struck, and you know we are
        expected in a quarter of an hour.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0071m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To be sure!&mdash;to be sure!&rdquo; cried Dantès, eagerly quitting
        the table; &ldquo;let us go directly!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        His words were re-echoed by the whole party, with vociferous cheers.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment Danglars, who had been incessantly observing every change
        in Fernand&rsquo;s look and manner, saw him stagger and fall back, with an
        almost convulsive spasm, against a seat placed near one of the open
        windows. At the same instant his ear caught a sort of indistinct sound on
        the stairs, followed by the measured tread of soldiery, with the clanking
        of swords and military accoutrements; then came a hum and buzz as of many
        voices, so as to deaden even the noisy mirth of the bridal party, among
        whom a vague feeling of curiosity and apprehension quelled every
        disposition to talk, and almost instantaneously the most deathlike
        stillness prevailed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sounds drew nearer. Three blows were struck upon the panel of the
        door. The company looked at each other in consternation.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I demand admittance,&rdquo; said a loud voice outside the room,
        &ldquo;in the name of the law!&rdquo; As no attempt was made to prevent
        it, the door was opened, and a magistrate, wearing his official scarf,
        presented himself, followed by four soldiers and a corporal. Uneasiness
        now yielded to the most extreme dread on the part of those present.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;May I venture to inquire the reason of this unexpected visit?&rdquo;
        said M. Morrel, addressing the magistrate, whom he evidently knew; &ldquo;there
        is doubtless some mistake easily explained.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If it be so,&rdquo; replied the magistrate, &ldquo;rely upon every
        reparation being made; meanwhile, I am the bearer of an order of arrest,
        and although I most reluctantly perform the task assigned me, it must,
        nevertheless, be fulfilled. Who among the persons here assembled answers
        to the name of Edmond Dantès?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Every eye was turned towards the young man who, spite of the agitation he
        could not but feel, advanced with dignity, and said, in a firm voice:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am he; what is your pleasure with me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Edmond Dantès,&rdquo; replied the magistrate, &ldquo;I arrest you
        in the name of the law!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Me!&rdquo; repeated Edmond, slightly changing color, &ldquo;and
        wherefore, I pray?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I cannot inform you, but you will be duly acquainted with the
        reasons that have rendered such a step necessary at the preliminary
        examination.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        M. Morrel felt that further resistance or remonstrance was useless. He saw
        before him an officer delegated to enforce the law, and perfectly well
        knew that it would be as unavailing to seek pity from a magistrate decked
        with his official scarf, as to address a petition to some cold marble
        effigy. Old Dantès, however, sprang forward. There are situations which
        the heart of a father or a mother cannot be made to understand. He prayed
        and supplicated in terms so moving, that even the officer was touched,
        and, although firm in his duty, he kindly said, &ldquo;My worthy friend,
        let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions. Your son has probably
        neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his cargo, and
        it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly he has given
        the information required, whether touching the health of his crew, or the
        value of his freight.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is the meaning of all this?&rdquo; inquired Caderousse,
        frowningly, of Danglars, who had assumed an air of utter surprise.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0073m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How can I tell you?&rdquo; replied he; &ldquo;I am, like yourself,
        utterly bewildered at all that is going on, and cannot in the least make
        out what it is about.&rdquo; Caderousse then looked around for Fernand,
        but he had disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling
        clearness. The painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared
        effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication of the
        evening before had raised between himself and his memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So, so,&rdquo; said he, in a hoarse and choking voice, to Danglars,
        &ldquo;this, then, I suppose, is a part of the trick you were concerting
        yesterday? All I can say is, that if it be so, &rsquo;tis an ill turn, and
        well deserves to bring double evil on those who have projected it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; returned Danglars, &ldquo;I tell you again I have
        nothing whatever to do with it; besides, you know very well that I tore
        the paper to pieces.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, you did not!&rdquo; answered Caderousse, &ldquo;you merely
        threw it by&mdash;I saw it lying in a corner.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Hold your tongue, you fool!&mdash;what should you know about it?&mdash;why,
        you were drunk!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where is Fernand?&rdquo; inquired Caderousse.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; replied Danglars; &ldquo;gone, as every
        prudent man ought to be, to look after his own affairs, most likely. Never
        mind where he is, let you and I go and see what is to be done for our poor
        friends.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        During this conversation, Dantès, after having exchanged a cheerful shake
        of the hand with all his sympathizing friends, had surrendered himself to
        the officer sent to arrest him, merely saying, &ldquo;Make yourselves
        quite easy, my good fellows, there is some little mistake to clear up,
        that&rsquo;s all, depend upon it; and very likely I may not have to go so
        far as the prison to effect that.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0075m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, to be sure!&rdquo; responded Danglars, who had now approached
        the group, &ldquo;nothing more than a mistake, I feel quite certain.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Dantès descended the staircase, preceded by the magistrate, and followed
        by the soldiers. A carriage awaited him at the door; he got in, followed
        by two soldiers and the magistrate, and the vehicle drove off towards
        Marseilles.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Adieu, adieu, dearest Edmond!&rdquo; cried Mercédès, stretching out
        her arms to him from the balcony.
      </p>
      <p>
        The prisoner heard the cry, which sounded like the sob of a broken heart,
        and leaning from the coach he called out, &ldquo;Good-bye, Mercédès&mdash;we
        shall soon meet again!&rdquo; Then the vehicle disappeared round one of
        the turnings of Fort Saint Nicholas.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Wait for me here, all of you!&rdquo; cried M. Morrel; &ldquo;I will
        take the first conveyance I find, and hurry to Marseilles, whence I will
        bring you word how all is going on.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rdquo; exclaimed a multitude of voices, &ldquo;go,
        and return as quickly as you can!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        This second departure was followed by a long and fearful state of
        terrified silence on the part of those who were left behind. The old
        father and Mercédès remained for some time apart, each absorbed in grief;
        but at length the two poor victims of the same blow raised their eyes, and
        with a simultaneous burst of feeling rushed into each other&rsquo;s arms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile Fernand made his appearance, poured out for himself a glass of
        water with a trembling hand; then hastily swallowing it, went to sit down
        at the first vacant place, and this was, by mere chance, placed next to
        the seat on which poor Mercédès had fallen half fainting, when released
        from the warm and affectionate embrace of old Dantès. Instinctively
        Fernand drew back his chair.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is the cause of all this misery&mdash;I am quite sure of it,&rdquo;
        whispered Caderousse, who had never taken his eyes off Fernand, to
        Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; answered the other; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
        too stupid to imagine such a scheme. I only hope the mischief will fall
        upon the head of whoever wrought it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mention those who aided and abetted the deed,&rdquo;
        said Caderousse.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; answered Danglars, &ldquo;one cannot be held
        responsible for every chance arrow shot into the air.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You can, indeed, when the arrow lights point downward on somebody&rsquo;s
        head.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Meantime the subject of the arrest was being canvassed in every different
        form.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What think you, Danglars,&rdquo; said one of the party, turning
        towards him, &ldquo;of this event?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;I think it just possible Dantès may
        have been detected with some trifling article on board ship considered
        here as contraband.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But how could he have done so without your knowledge, Danglars,
        since you are the ship&rsquo;s supercargo?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, as for that, I could only know what I was told respecting the
        merchandise with which the vessel was laden. I know she was loaded with
        cotton, and that she took in her freight at Alexandria from Pastret&rsquo;s
        warehouse, and at Smyrna from Pascal&rsquo;s; that is all I was obliged to
        know, and I beg I may not be asked for any further particulars.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now I recollect,&rdquo; said the afflicted old father; &ldquo;my
        poor boy told me yesterday he had got a small case of coffee, and another
        of tobacco for me!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There, you see,&rdquo; exclaimed Danglars. &ldquo;Now the mischief
        is out; depend upon it the custom-house people went rummaging about the
        ship in our absence, and discovered poor Dantès&rsquo; hidden treasures.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Mercédès, however, paid no heed to this explanation of her lover&rsquo;s
        arrest. Her grief, which she had hitherto tried to restrain, now burst out
        in a violent fit of hysterical sobbing.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;be comforted, my poor
        child; there is still hope!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Hope!&rdquo; repeated Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Hope!&rdquo; faintly murmured Fernand, but the word seemed to die
        away on his pale agitated lips, and a convulsive spasm passed over his
        countenance.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Good news! good news!&rdquo; shouted forth one of the party
        stationed in the balcony on the lookout. &ldquo;Here comes M. Morrel back.
        No doubt, now, we shall hear that our friend is released!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Mercédès and the old man rushed to meet the shipowner and greeted him at
        the door. He was very pale.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What news?&rdquo; exclaimed a general burst of voices.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas, my friends,&rdquo; replied M. Morrel, with a mournful shake
        of his head, &ldquo;the thing has assumed a more serious aspect than I
        expected.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, indeed&mdash;indeed, sir, he is innocent!&rdquo; sobbed forth
        Mercédès.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That I believe!&rdquo; answered M. Morrel; &ldquo;but still he is
        charged&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With what?&rdquo; inquired the elder Dantès.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With being an agent of the Bonapartist faction!&rdquo; Many of our
        readers may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became
        in the period at which our story is dated.
      </p>
      <p>
        A despairing cry escaped the pale lips of Mercédès; the old man sank into
        a chair.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, Danglars!&rdquo; whispered Caderousse, &ldquo;you have deceived
        me&mdash;the trick you spoke of last night has been played; but I cannot
        suffer a poor old man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your
        fault. I am determined to tell them all about it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Be silent, you simpleton!&rdquo; cried Danglars, grasping him by
        the arm, &ldquo;or I will not answer even for your own safety. Who can
        tell whether Dantès be innocent or guilty? The vessel did touch at Elba,
        where he quitted it, and passed a whole day in the island. Now, should any
        letters or other documents of a compromising character be found upon him,
        will it not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his
        accomplices?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        With the rapid instinct of selfishness, Caderousse readily perceived the
        solidity of this mode of reasoning; he gazed, doubtfully, wistfully, on
        Danglars, and then caution supplanted generosity.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Suppose we wait a while, and see what comes of it,&rdquo; said he,
        casting a bewildered look on his companion.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To be sure!&rdquo; answered Danglars. &ldquo;Let us wait, by all
        means. If he be innocent, of course he will be set at liberty; if guilty,
        why, it is no use involving ourselves in a conspiracy.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us go, then. I cannot stay here any longer.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With all my heart!&rdquo; replied Danglars, pleased to find the
        other so tractable. &ldquo;Let us take ourselves out of the way, and leave
        things for the present to take their course.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        After their departure, Fernand, who had now again become the friend and
        protector of Mercédès, led the girl to her home, while some friends of
        Dantès conducted his father, nearly lifeless, to the Allées de Meilhan.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rumor of Edmond&rsquo;s arrest as a Bonapartist agent was not slow in
        circulating throughout the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Could you ever have credited such a thing, my dear Danglars?&rdquo;
        asked M. Morrel, as, on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning
        fresh tidings of Dantès, from M. de Villefort, the assistant procureur, he
        overtook his supercargo and Caderousse. &ldquo;Could you have believed
        such a thing possible?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, you know I told you,&rdquo; replied Danglars, &ldquo;that I
        considered the circumstance of his having anchored at the Island of Elba
        as a very suspicious circumstance.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0079m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; returned Danglars. Then added in a low
        whisper, &ldquo;You understand that, on account of your uncle, M. Policar
        Morrel, who served under the <i>other</i> government, and who does not
        altogether conceal what he thinks on the subject, you are strongly
        suspected of regretting the abdication of Napoleon. I should have feared
        to injure both Edmond and yourself, had I divulged my own apprehensions to
        a soul. I am too well aware that though a subordinate, like myself, is
        bound to acquaint the shipowner with everything that occurs, there are
        many things he ought most carefully to conceal from all else.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis well, Danglars&mdash;&rsquo;tis well!&rdquo; replied M.
        Morrel. &ldquo;You are a worthy fellow; and I had already thought of your
        interests in the event of poor Edmond having become captain of the <i>Pharaon</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is it possible you were so kind?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, indeed; I had previously inquired of Dantès what was his
        opinion of you, and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in
        your post, for somehow I have perceived a sort of coolness between you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what was his reply?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair
        which he merely referred to without entering into particulars, but that
        whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the ship&rsquo;s
        owners would have his preference also.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The hypocrite!&rdquo; murmured Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Poor Dantès!&rdquo; said Caderousse. &ldquo;No one can deny his
        being a noble-hearted young fellow.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But meanwhile,&rdquo; continued M. Morrel, &ldquo;here is the <i>Pharaon</i>
        without a captain.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; replied Danglars, &ldquo;since we cannot leave this port
        for the next three months, let us hope that ere the expiration of that
        period Dantès will be set at liberty.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No doubt; but in the meantime?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am entirely at your service, M. Morrel,&rdquo; answered Danglars.
        &ldquo;You know that I am as capable of managing a ship as the most
        experienced captain in the service; and it will be so far advantageous to
        you to accept my services, that upon Edmond&rsquo;s release from prison no
        further change will be requisite on board the <i>Pharaon</i> than for
        Dantès and myself each to resume our respective posts.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thanks, Danglars&mdash;that will smooth over all difficulties. I
        fully authorize you at once to assume the command of the <i>Pharaon</i>,
        and look carefully to the unloading of her freight. Private misfortunes
        must never be allowed to interfere with business.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Be easy on that score, M. Morrel; but do you think we shall be
        permitted to see our poor Edmond?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will let you know that directly I have seen M. de Villefort, whom
        I shall endeavor to interest in Edmond&rsquo;s favor. I am aware he is a
        furious royalist; but, in spite of that, and of his being king&rsquo;s
        attorney, he is a man like ourselves, and I fancy not a bad sort of one.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; replied Danglars; &ldquo;but I hear that he is
        ambitious, and that&rsquo;s rather against him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; returned M. Morrel, &ldquo;we shall see. But now
        hasten on board, I will join you there ere long.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        So saying, the worthy shipowner quitted the two allies, and proceeded in the
        direction of the Palais de Justice.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0081m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Danglars, addressing Caderousse, &ldquo;the
        turn things have taken. Do you still feel any desire to stand up in his
        defence?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not the slightest, but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a
        mere joke should lead to such consequences.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But who perpetrated that joke, let me ask? neither you nor myself,
        but Fernand; you knew very well that I threw the paper into a corner of
        the room&mdash;indeed, I fancied I had destroyed it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; replied Caderousse, &ldquo;that I can answer for,
        you did not. I only wish I could see it now as plainly as I saw it lying
        all crushed and crumpled in a corner of the arbor.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, if you did, depend upon it, Fernand picked it up, and
        either copied it or caused it to be copied; perhaps, even, he did not take
        the trouble of recopying it. And now I think of it, by Heavens, he may
        have sent the letter itself! Fortunately, for me, the handwriting was
        disguised.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you were aware of Dantès being engaged in a conspiracy?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not I. As I before said, I thought the whole thing was a joke,
        nothing more. It seems, however, that I have unconsciously stumbled upon
        the truth.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; argued Caderousse, &ldquo;I would give a great deal
        if nothing of the kind had happened; or, at least, that I had had no hand
        in it. You will see, Danglars, that it will turn out an unlucky job for
        both of us.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nonsense! If any harm come of it, it should fall on the guilty
        person; and that, you know, is Fernand. How can we be implicated in any
        way? All we have got to do is, to keep our own counsel, and remain
        perfectly quiet, not breathing a word to any living soul; and you will see
        that the storm will pass away without in the least affecting us.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; responded Caderousse, waving his hand in token of
        adieu to Danglars, and bending his steps towards the Allées de Meilhan,
        moving his head to and fro, and muttering as he went, after the manner of
        one whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So far, then,&rdquo; said Danglars, mentally, &ldquo;all has gone
        as I would have it. I am, temporarily, commander of the <i>Pharaon</i>,
        with the certainty of being permanently so, if that fool of a Caderousse
        can be persuaded to hold his tongue. My only fear is the chance of Dantès
        being released. But, there, he is in the hands of Justice; and,&rdquo;
        added he with a smile, &ldquo;she will take her own.&rdquo; So saying, he
        leaped into a boat, desiring to be rowed on board the <i>Pharaon</i>,
        where M. Morrel had agreed to meet him.
