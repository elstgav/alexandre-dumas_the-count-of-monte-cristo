![Preview](/images/preview.png)

An illustrated and enhanced digital edition of the literary classic.

Originally developed for consideration by the [Standard Ebooks Project](https://standardebooks.org/), this copy instead adds original illustrations sourced from the digital scans available at the [HathiTrust Digital Library](https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007698091), and is based on a transcription produced in 1998 by Anonymous Project Gutenberg Volunteers, Dan Muller, and David Widger for [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/1184).

Standard Ebooks maintains its own edition, available at [standardebooks/alexandre-dumas_the-count-of-monte-cristo_chapman-and-hall](https://github.com/standardebooks/alexandre-dumas_the-count-of-monte-cristo_chapman-and-hall).
