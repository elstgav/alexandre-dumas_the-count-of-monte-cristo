      <h2>Chapter 32. The Waking</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Franz returned
        to himself, he seemed still to be in a dream. He thought himself in a
        sepulchre, into which a ray of sunlight in pity scarcely penetrated. He
        stretched forth his hand, and touched stone; he rose to his seat, and
        found himself lying on his bournous in a bed of dry heather, very soft and
        odoriferous. The vision had fled; and as if the statues had been but
        shadows from the tomb, they had vanished at his waking.
      </p>
      <p>
        He advanced several paces towards the point whence the light came, and to
        all the excitement of his dream succeeded the calmness of reality. He
        found that he was in a grotto, went towards the opening, and through a
        kind of fanlight saw a blue sea and an azure sky. The air and water were
        shining in the beams of the morning sun; on the shore the sailors were
        sitting, chatting and laughing; and at ten yards from them the boat was at
        anchor, undulating gracefully on the water.
      </p>
      <p>
        There for some time he enjoyed the fresh breeze which played on his brow,
        and listened to the dash of the waves on the beach, that left against the
        rocks a lace of foam as white as silver. He was for some time without
        reflection or thought for the divine charm which is in the things of
        nature, specially after a fantastic dream; then gradually this view of the
        outer world, so calm, so pure, so grand, reminded him of the illusiveness
        of his vision, and once more awakened memory. He recalled his arrival on
        the island, his presentation to a smuggler chief, a subterranean palace
        full of splendor, an excellent supper, and a spoonful of hashish.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed, however, even in the very face of open day, that at least a
        year had elapsed since all these things had passed, so deep was the
        impression made in his mind by the dream, and so strong a hold had it
        taken of his imagination. Thus every now and then he saw in fancy amid the
        sailors, seated on a rock, or undulating in the vessel, one of the shadows
        which had shared his dream with looks and kisses. Otherwise, his head was
        perfectly clear, and his body refreshed; he was free from the slightest
        headache; on the contrary, he felt a certain degree of lightness, a
        faculty for absorbing the pure air, and enjoying the bright sunshine more
        vividly than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        He went gayly up to the sailors, who rose as soon as they perceived him;
        and the patron, accosting him, said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The Signor Sinbad has left his compliments for your excellency, and
        desires us to express the regret he feels at not being able to take his leave
        in person; but he trusts you will excuse him, as very important business calls
        him to Malaga.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So, then, Gaetano,&rdquo; said Franz, &ldquo;this is, then, all
        reality; there exists a man who has received me in this island,
        entertained me right royally, and has departed while I was asleep?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He exists as certainly as that you may see his small yacht with all
        her sails spread; and if you will use your glass, you will, in all
        probability, recognize your host in the midst of his crew.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        So saying, Gaetano pointed in a direction in which a small vessel was
        making sail towards the southern point of Corsica. Franz adjusted his
        telescope, and directed it towards the yacht. Gaetano was not mistaken. At
        the stern the mysterious stranger was standing up looking towards the
        shore, and holding a spy-glass in his hand. He was attired as he had been
        on the previous evening, and waved his pocket-handkerchief to his guest in
        token of adieu. Franz returned the salute by shaking his handkerchief as
        an exchange of signals. After a second, a slight cloud of smoke was seen
        at the stern of the vessel, which rose gracefully as it expanded in the
        air, and then Franz heard a slight report.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There, do you hear?&rdquo; observed Gaetano; &ldquo;he is bidding
        you adieu.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The young man took his carbine and fired it in the air, but without any
        idea that the noise could be heard at the distance which separated the
        yacht from the shore.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What are your excellency&rsquo;s orders?&rdquo; inquired Gaetano.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In the first place, light me a torch.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, yes, I understand,&rdquo; replied the patron, &ldquo;to find
        the entrance to the enchanted apartment. With much pleasure, your
        excellency, if it would amuse you; and I will get you the torch you ask
        for. But I too have had the idea you have, and two or three times the same
        fancy has come over me; but I have always given it up. Giovanni, light a
        torch,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;and give it to his excellency.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Giovanni obeyed. Franz took the lamp, and entered the subterranean grotto,
        followed by Gaetano. He recognized the place where he had awaked by the
        bed of heather that was there; but it was in vain that he carried his
        torch all round the exterior surface of the grotto. He saw nothing, unless
        that, by traces of smoke, others had before him attempted the same thing,
        and, like him, in vain. Yet he did not leave a foot of this granite wall,
        as impenetrable as futurity, without strict scrutiny; he did not see a
        fissure without introducing the blade of his hunting sword into it, or a
        projecting point on which he did not lean and press in the hopes it would
        give way. All was vain; and he lost two hours in his attempts, which were
        at last utterly useless. At the end of this time he gave up his search,
        and Gaetano smiled.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Franz appeared again on the shore, the yacht only seemed like a small
        white speck on the horizon. He looked again through his glass, but even
        then he could not distinguish anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gaetano reminded him that he had come for the purpose of shooting goats,
        which he had utterly forgotten. He took his fowling-piece, and began to
        hunt over the island with the air of a man who is fulfilling a duty,
        rather than enjoying a pleasure; and at the end of a quarter of an hour he
        had killed a goat and two kids. These animals, though wild and agile as
        chamois, were too much like domestic goats, and Franz could not consider
        them as game. Moreover, other ideas, much more enthralling, occupied his
        mind. Since, the evening before, he had really been the hero of one of the
        tales of the <i>Thousand and One Nights</i>, and he was irresistibly
        attracted towards the grotto.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, in spite of the failure of his first search, he began a second,
        after having told Gaetano to roast one of the two kids. The second visit
        was a long one, and when he returned the kid was roasted and the repast
        ready. Franz was sitting on the spot where he was on the previous evening
        when his mysterious host had invited him to supper; and he saw the little
        yacht, now like a sea-gull on the wave, continuing her flight towards
        Corsica.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he remarked to Gaetano, &ldquo;you told me that Signor
        Sinbad was going to Malaga, while it seems he is in the direction of
        Porto-Vecchio.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember,&rdquo; said the patron, &ldquo;I told you
        that among the crew there were two Corsican brigands?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;True; and he is going to land them,&rdquo; added Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Precisely so,&rdquo; replied Gaetano. &ldquo;Ah, he is one who
        fears neither God nor Satan, they say, and would at any time run fifty
        leagues out of his course to do a poor devil a service.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20093m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But such services as these might involve him with the authorities
        of the country in which he practices this kind of philanthropy,&rdquo;
        said Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what cares he for that,&rdquo; replied Gaetano with a laugh,
        &ldquo;or any authorities? He smiles at them. Let them try to pursue him!
        Why, in the first place, his yacht is not a ship, but a bird, and he would
        beat any frigate three knots in every nine; and if he were to throw
        himself on the coast, why, is he not certain of finding friends
        everywhere?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        It was perfectly clear that the Signor Sinbad, Franz&rsquo;s host, had the
        honor of being on excellent terms with the smugglers and bandits along the
        whole coast of the Mediterranean, and so enjoyed exceptional privileges.
        As to Franz, he had no longer any inducement to remain at Monte Cristo. He
        had lost all hope of detecting the secret of the grotto; he consequently
        despatched his breakfast, and, his boat being ready, he hastened on board,
        and they were soon under way. At the moment the boat began her course they
        lost sight of the yacht, as it disappeared in the gulf of Porto-Vecchio.
        With it was effaced the last trace of the preceding night; and then
        supper, Sinbad, hashish, statues,&mdash;all became a dream for Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        The boat sailed on all day and all night, and next morning, when the sun rose,
        they had lost sight of Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        When Franz had once again set foot on shore, he forgot, for the moment at
        least, the events which had just passed, while he finished his affairs of
        pleasure at Florence, and then thought of nothing but how he should rejoin
        his companion, who was awaiting him at Rome.
      </p>
      <p>
        He set out, and on the Saturday evening reached the Place de la Douane by
        the mail-coach. An apartment, as we have said, had been retained
        beforehand, and thus he had but to go to Signor Pastrini&rsquo;s hotel.
        But this was not so easy a matter, for the streets were thronged with
        people, and Rome was already a prey to that low and feverish murmur which
        precedes all great events; and at Rome there are four great events in
        every year,&mdash;the Carnival, Holy Week, Corpus Christi, and the Feast
        of St. Peter.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the rest of the year the city is in that state of dull apathy, between
        life and death, which renders it similar to a kind of station between this
        world and the next&mdash;a sublime spot, a resting-place full of poetry and
        character, and at which Franz had already halted five or six times, and at
        each time found it more marvellous and striking.
      </p>
      <p>
        At last he made his way through the mob, which was continually increasing
        and getting more and more turbulent, and reached the hotel. On his first
        inquiry he was told, with the impertinence peculiar to hired
        hackney-coachmen and innkeepers with their houses full, that there was no
        room for him at the Hôtel de Londres. Then he sent his card to Signor
        Pastrini, and asked for Albert de Morcerf. This plan succeeded; and Signor
        Pastrini himself ran to him, excusing himself for having made his
        excellency wait, scolding the waiters, taking the candlestick from the
        porter, who was ready to pounce on the traveller and was about to lead him
        to Albert, when Morcerf himself appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        The apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor. The two rooms
        looked on to the street&mdash;a fact which Signor Pastrini commented upon
        as an inappreciable advantage. The rest of the floor was hired by a very
        rich gentleman who was supposed to be a Sicilian or Maltese; but the host
        was unable to decide to which of the two nations the traveller belonged.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very good, signor Pastrini,&rdquo; said Franz; &ldquo;but we must
        have some supper instantly, and a carriage for tomorrow and the following
        days.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As to supper,&rdquo; replied the landlord, &ldquo;you shall be
        served immediately; but as for the carriage&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What as to the carriage?&rdquo; exclaimed Albert. &ldquo;Come,
        come, Signor Pastrini, no joking; we must have a carriage.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; replied the host, &ldquo;we will do all in our power to
        procure you one&mdash;this is all I can say.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And when shall we know?&rdquo; inquired Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Tomorrow morning,&rdquo; answered the innkeeper.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, the deuce! then we shall pay the more, that&rsquo;s all, I see
        plainly enough. At Drake&rsquo;s or Aaron&rsquo;s one pays twenty-five
        lire for common days, and thirty or thirty-five lire a day more for
        Sundays and feast days; add five lire a day more for extras, that will
        make forty, and there&rsquo;s an end of it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am afraid if we offer them double that we shall not procure a
        carriage.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then they must put horses to mine. It is a little worse for the
        journey, but that&rsquo;s no matter.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There are no horses.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Albert looked at Franz like a man who hears a reply he does not understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you understand that, my dear Franz&mdash;no horses?&rdquo; he
        said, &ldquo;but can&rsquo;t we have post-horses?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They have been all hired this fortnight, and there are none left
        but those absolutely requisite for posting.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What are we to say to this?&rdquo; asked Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I say, that when a thing completely surpasses my comprehension, I
        am accustomed not to dwell on that thing, but to pass to another. Is
        supper ready, Signor Pastrini?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, your excellency.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, let us sup.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But the carriage and horses?&rdquo; said Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Be easy, my dear boy; they will come in due season; it is only a
        question of how much shall be charged for them.&rdquo; Morcerf then, with
        that delighted philosophy which believes that nothing is impossible to a
        full purse or well-lined pocketbook, supped, went to bed, slept soundly,
        and dreamed he was racing all over Rome at Carnival time in a coach with
        six horses.
