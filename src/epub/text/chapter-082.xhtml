      <h2>Chapter 82. The Burglary</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he day following
        that on which the conversation we have related took place, the Count of
        Monte Cristo set out for Auteuil, accompanied by Ali and several
        attendants, and also taking with him some horses whose qualities he was
        desirous of ascertaining. He was induced to undertake this journey, of
        which the day before he had not even thought and which had not occurred to
        Andrea either, by the arrival of Bertuccio from Normandy with intelligence
        respecting the house and sloop. The house was ready, and the sloop which
        had arrived a week before lay at anchor in a small creek with her crew of
        six men, who had observed all the requisite formalities and were ready
        again to put to sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        The count praised Bertuccio&rsquo;s zeal, and ordered him to prepare for a
        speedy departure, as his stay in France would not be prolonged more than a month.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I may require to go in one night from Paris
        to Tréport; let eight fresh horses be in readiness on the road, which will
        enable me to go fifty leagues in ten hours.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your highness had already expressed that wish,&rdquo; said
        Bertuccio, &ldquo;and the horses are ready. I have bought them, and
        stationed them myself at the most desirable posts, that is, in villages,
        where no one generally stops.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s well,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo; &ldquo;I remain here a
        day or two&mdash;arrange accordingly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        As Bertuccio was leaving the room to give the requisite orders, Baptistin
        opened the door: he held a letter on a silver waiter.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo; asked the count, seeing him covered
        with dust; &ldquo;I did not send for you, I think?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Baptistin, without answering, approached the count, and presented the
        letter. &ldquo;Important and urgent,&rdquo; said he.
      </p>
      <p>
        The count opened the letter, and read:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;M. de Monte Cristo is apprised that this night a man will enter his
        house in the Champs-Élysées with the intention of carrying off some papers
        supposed to be in the secretaire in the dressing-room. The count&rsquo;s
        well-known courage will render unnecessary the aid of the police, whose
        interference might seriously affect him who sends this advice. The count,
        by any opening from the bedroom, or by concealing himself in the
        dressing-room, would be able to defend his property himself. Many
        attendants or apparent precautions would prevent the villain from the
        attempt, and M. de Monte Cristo would lose the opportunity of discovering
        an enemy whom chance has revealed to him who now sends this warning to the
        count,&mdash;a warning he might not be able to send another time, if this
        first attempt should fail and another be made.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The count&rsquo;s first idea was that this was an artifice&mdash;a gross
        deception, to draw his attention from a minor danger in order to expose
        him to a greater. He was on the point of sending the letter to the
        commissary of police, notwithstanding the advice of his anonymous friend,
        or perhaps because of that advice, when suddenly the idea occurred to him
        that it might be some personal enemy, whom he alone should recognize and
        over whom, if such were the case, he alone would gain any advantage, as
        Fiesco<a href="#linknote-17" name="linknoteref-17" id="linknoteref-17">17</a> had
        done over the Moor who would have killed him. We know the
        count&rsquo;s vigorous and daring mind, denying anything to be impossible,
        with that energy which marks the great man.
      </p>
      <p>
        From his past life, from his resolution to shrink from nothing, the count had
        acquired an inconceivable relish for the contests in which he had engaged,
        sometimes against nature, that is to say, against God, and sometimes against
        the world, that is, against the devil.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They do not want my papers,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, &ldquo;they
        want to kill me; they are no robbers, but assassins. I will not allow the
        prefect of police to interfere with my private affairs. I am rich enough,
        forsooth, to distribute his authority on this occasion.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The count recalled Baptistin, who had left the room after delivering the letter.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Return to Paris,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;assemble the servants who
        remain there. I want all my household at Auteuil.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But will no one remain in the house, my lord?&rdquo; asked
        Baptistin.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, the porter.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My lord will remember that the lodge is at a distance from the
        house.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The house might be stripped without his hearing the least noise.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By thieves.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are a fool, M. Baptistin. Thieves might strip the house&mdash;it
        would annoy me less than to be disobeyed.&rdquo; Baptistin bowed.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40150m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You understand me?&rdquo; said the count. &ldquo;Bring your
        comrades here, one and all; but let everything remain as usual, only close
        the shutters of the ground floor.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And those of the first floor?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You know they are never closed. Go!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The count signified his intention of dining alone, and that no one but Ali
        should attend him. Having dined with his usual tranquillity and
        moderation, the count, making a signal to Ali to follow him, went out by
        the side-gate and on reaching the Bois de Boulogne turned, apparently
        without design towards Paris and at twilight; found himself opposite his
        house in the Champs-Élysées. All was dark; one solitary, feeble light was
        burning in the porter&rsquo;s lodge, about forty paces distant from the
        house, as Baptistin had said.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo leaned against a tree, and with that scrutinizing glance which was
        so rarely deceived, looked up and down the avenue, examined the passers-by, and
        carefully looked down the neighboring streets, to see that no one was concealed.
        Ten minutes passed thus, and he was convinced that no one was watching him. He
        hastened to the side-door with Ali, entered hurriedly, and by the servants&rsquo;
        staircase, of which he had the key, gained his bedroom without opening or
        disarranging a single curtain, without even the porter having the
        slightest suspicion that the house, which he supposed empty, contained its
        chief occupant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrived in his bedroom, the count motioned to Ali to stop; then he passed
        into the dressing-room, which he examined. Everything appeared as usual&mdash;the
        precious secretaire in its place, and the key in the secretaire.
        He double locked it, took the key, returned to the bedroom door, removed
        the double staple of the bolt, and went in. Meanwhile Ali had procured the
        arms the count required&mdash;namely, a short carbine and a pair of
        double-barrelled pistols, with which as sure an aim might be taken as with
        a single-barrelled one. Thus armed, the count held the lives of five men
        in his hands. It was about half-past nine.
      </p>
      <p>
        The count and Ali ate in haste a crust of bread and drank a glass of Spanish wine;
        then Monte Cristo slipped aside one of the movable panels, which enabled him to
        see into the adjoining room. He had within his reach his pistols and carbine, and
        Ali, standing near him, held one of the small Arabian hatchets, whose form has
        not varied since the Crusades. Through one of the windows of the bedroom,
        on a line with that in the dressing-room, the count could see into the street.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two hours passed thus. It was intensely dark; still Ali, thanks to his
        wild nature, and the count, thanks doubtless to his long confinement,
        could distinguish in the darkness the slightest movement of the trees. The
        little light in the lodge had long been extinct. It might be expected that
        the attack, if indeed an attack was projected, would be made from the
        staircase of the ground floor, and not from a window; in Monte Cristo&rsquo;s
        opinion, the villains sought his life, not his money. It would be his
        bedroom they would attack, and they must reach it by the back staircase,
        or by the window in the dressing-room.
      </p>
      <p>
        The clock of the Invalides struck a quarter to twelve; the west wind bore on
        its moistened gusts the doleful vibration of the three strokes.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40152m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        As the last stroke died away, the count thought he heard a slight noise in
        the dressing-room; this first sound, or rather this first grinding, was
        followed by a second, then a third; at the fourth, the count knew what to
        expect. A firm and well-practised hand was engaged in cutting the four
        sides of a pane of glass with a diamond. The count felt his heart beat
        more rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inured as men may be to danger, forewarned as they may be of peril, they
        understand, by the fluttering of the heart and the shuddering of the frame, the
        enormous difference between a dream and a reality, between the project and the
        execution. However, Monte Cristo only made a sign to apprise Ali, who,
        understanding that danger was approaching from the other side, drew nearer to his
        master. Monte Cristo was eager to ascertain the strength and number of his enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The window whence the noise proceeded was opposite the opening by which
        the count could see into the dressing-room. He fixed his eyes on that
        window&mdash;he distinguished a shadow in the darkness; then one of the
        panes became quite opaque, as if a sheet of paper were stuck on the
        outside, then the square cracked without falling. Through the opening an
        arm was passed to find the fastening, then a second; the window turned on
        its hinges, and a man entered. He was alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a daring rascal,&rdquo; whispered the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        At that moment Ali touched him slightly on the shoulder. He turned; Ali
        pointed to the window of the room in which they were, facing the street.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I see!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there are two of them; one does the
        work while the other stands guard.&rdquo; He made a sign to Ali not to
        lose sight of the man in the street, and turned to the one in the
        dressing-room.
      </p>
      <p>
        The glass-cutter had entered, and was feeling his way, his arms stretched
        out before him. At last he appeared to have made himself familiar with his
        surroundings. There were two doors; he bolted them both.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he drew near to the bedroom door, Monte Cristo expected that he was
        coming in, and raised one of his pistols; but he simply heard the sound of
        the bolts sliding in their copper rings. It was only a precaution. The
        nocturnal visitor, ignorant of the fact that the count had removed the
        staples, might now think himself at home, and pursue his purpose with full
        security. Alone and free to act as he wished, the man then drew from his
        pocket something which the count could not discern, placed it on a stand,
        then went straight to the secretaire, felt the lock, and contrary to
        his expectation found that the key was missing. But the glass-cutter was a
        prudent man who had provided for all emergencies. The count soon heard the
        rattling of a bunch of skeleton keys, such as the locksmith brings when
        called to force a lock, and which thieves call nightingales, doubtless
        from the music of their nightly song when they grind against the bolt.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, ha,&rdquo; whispered Monte Cristo with a smile of
        disappointment, &ldquo;he is only a thief.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        But the man in the dark could not find the right key. He reached the
        instrument he had placed on the stand, touched a spring, and immediately a
        pale light, just bright enough to render objects distinct, was reflected
        on his hands and countenance.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By heavens,&rdquo; exclaimed Monte Cristo, starting back,
        &ldquo;it is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Ali raised his hatchet.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stir,&rdquo; whispered Monte Cristo, &ldquo;and put down your
        hatchet; we shall require no arms.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40154m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        Then he added some words in a low tone, for the exclamation which surprise
        had drawn from the count, faint as it had been, had startled the man who
        remained in the pose of the old knife-grinder.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was an order the count had just given, for immediately Ali went noiselessly,
        and returned, bearing a black dress and a three-cornered hat. Meanwhile Monte
        Cristo had rapidly taken off his greatcoat, waistcoat, and shirt, and one might
        distinguish by the glimmering through the open panel that he wore a pliant
        tunic of steel mail, of which the last in France, where daggers are no
        longer dreaded, was worn by King Louis XVI., who feared the dagger at his
        breast, and whose head was cleft with a hatchet. The tunic soon
        disappeared under a long cassock, as did his hair under a priest&rsquo;s
        wig; the three-cornered hat over this effectually transformed the count
        into an abbé.
      </p>
      <p>
        The man, hearing nothing more, stood erect, and while Monte Cristo was
        completing his disguise had advanced straight to the secretaire, whose
        lock was beginning to crack under his nightingale.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Try again,&rdquo; whispered the count, who depended on the secret
        spring, which was unknown to the picklock, clever as he might be&mdash;&ldquo;try
        again, you have a few minutes&rsquo; work there.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And he advanced to the window. The man whom he had seen seated on a fence had got
        down, and was still pacing the street; but, strange as it appeared, he cared not
        for those who might pass from the avenue of the Champs-Élysées or by the
        Faubourg Saint-Honoré; his attention was engrossed with what was passing
        at the count&rsquo;s, and his only aim appeared to be to discern every
        movement in the dressing-room.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo suddenly struck his finger on his forehead and a smile passed
        over his lips; then drawing near to Ali, he whispered:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Remain here, concealed in the dark, and whatever noise you hear,
        whatever passes, only come in or show yourself if I call you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Ali bowed in token of strict obedience. Monte Cristo then drew a lighted taper
        from a closet, and when the thief was deeply engaged with his lock,
        silently opened the door, taking care that the light should shine directly
        on his face. The door opened so quietly that the thief heard no sound;
        but, to his astonishment, the room was suddenly illuminated. He turned.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, good-evening, my dear M. Caderousse,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo;
        &ldquo;what are you doing here, at such an hour?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40156m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The Abbé Busoni!&rdquo; exclaimed Caderousse; and, not knowing how
        this strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors,
        he let fall his bunch of keys, and remained motionless and stupefied. The
        count placed himself between Caderousse and the window, thus cutting off
        from the thief his only chance of retreat.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The Abbé Busoni!&rdquo; repeated Caderousse, fixing his haggard
        gaze on the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, undoubtedly, the Abbé Busoni himself,&rdquo; replied Monte
        Cristo. &ldquo;And I am very glad you recognize me, dear M. Caderousse; it
        proves you have a good memory, for it must be about ten years since we
        last met.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        This calmness of Busoni, combined with his irony and boldness, staggered Caderousse.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The abbé, the abbé!&rdquo; murmured he, clenching his fists, and
        his teeth chattering.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So you would rob the Count of Monte Cristo?&rdquo; continued the
        false abbé.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Reverend sir,&rdquo; murmured Caderousse, seeking to regain the
        window, which the count pitilessly blocked&mdash;&ldquo;reverend sir, I
        don&rsquo;t know&mdash;believe me&mdash;I take my oath&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A pane of glass out,&rdquo; continued the count, &ldquo;a dark
        lantern, a bunch of false keys, a secretaire half forced&mdash;it is
        tolerably evident&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Caderousse was choking; he looked around for some corner to hide in, some
        way of escape.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; continued the count, &ldquo;I see you are still
        the same,&mdash;an assassin.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Reverend sir, since you know everything, you know it was not I&mdash;it
        was La Carconte; that was proved at the trial, since I was only condemned
        to the galleys.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is your time, then, expired, since I find you in a fair way to
        return there?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, reverend sir; I have been liberated by someone.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That someone has done society a great kindness.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Caderousse, &ldquo;I had promised&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you are breaking your promise!&rdquo; interrupted Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas, yes!&rdquo; said Caderousse very uneasily.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A bad relapse, that will lead you, if I mistake not, to the Place
        de Grève. So much the worse, so much the worse&mdash;<i>diavolo!</i> as
        they say in my country.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Reverend sir, I am impelled&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Every criminal says the same thing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Poverty&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said Busoni disdainfully; &ldquo;poverty may make a
        man beg, steal a loaf of bread at a baker&rsquo;s door, but not cause him
        to open a secretaire in a house supposed to be inhabited. And when the
        jeweller Johannes had just paid you 45,000 francs for the diamond I had
        given you, and you killed him to get the diamond and the money both, was
        that also poverty?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Pardon, reverend sir,&rdquo; said Caderousse; &ldquo;you have saved
        my life once, save me again!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is but poor encouragement.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you alone, reverend sir, or have you there soldiers ready to
        seize me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am alone,&rdquo; said the abbé, &ldquo;and I will again have pity
        on you, and will let you escape, at the risk of the fresh miseries my
        weakness may lead to, if you tell me the truth.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, reverend sir,&rdquo; cried Caderousse, clasping his hands, and
        drawing nearer to Monte Cristo, &ldquo;I may indeed say you are my
        deliverer!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You mean to say you have been freed from confinement?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, that is true, reverend sir.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Who was your liberator?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;An Englishman.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What was his name?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Lord Wilmore.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I know him; I shall know if you lie.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, reverend sir, I tell you the simple truth.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Was this Englishman protecting you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, not me, but a young Corsican, my companion.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What was this young Corsican&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Benedetto.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is that his Christian name?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He had no other; he was a foundling.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then this young man escaped with you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He did.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In what way?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We were working at Saint-Mandrier, near Toulon. Do you know
        Saint-Mandrier?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In the hour of rest, between noon and one o&rsquo;clock&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Galley-slaves having a nap after dinner! We may well pity the poor
        fellows!&rdquo; said the abbé.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Caderousse, &ldquo;one can&rsquo;t always work&mdash;one
        is not a dog.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So much the better for the dogs,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;While the rest slept, then, we went away a short distance; we
        severed our fetters with a file the Englishman had given us, and swam
        away.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what is become of this Benedetto?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You ought to know.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, in truth; we parted at Hyères.&rdquo; And, to give more weight
        to his protestation, Caderousse advanced another step towards the abbé,
        who remained motionless in his place, as calm as ever, and pursuing his
        interrogation.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You lie,&rdquo; said the Abbé Busoni, with a tone of irresistible authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Reverend sir!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You lie! This man is still your friend, and you, perhaps, make use
        of him as your accomplice.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40160m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, reverend sir!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Since you left Toulon what have you lived on? Answer me!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On what I could get.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You lie,&rdquo; repeated the abbé a third time, with a still more
        imperative tone. Caderousse, terrified, looked at the count. &ldquo;You
        have lived on the money he has given you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Caderousse; &ldquo;Benedetto has become the son
        of a great lord.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How can he be the son of a great lord?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A natural son.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what is that great lord&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The Count of Monte Cristo, the very same in whose house we are.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Benedetto the count&rsquo;s son?&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo,
        astonished in his turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I should think so, since the count has found him a false
        father&mdash;since the count gives him four thousand francs a month, and
        leaves him 500,000 francs in his will.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; said the factitious abbé, who began to understand;
        &ldquo;and what name does the young man bear meanwhile?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Andrea Cavalcanti.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is it, then, that young man whom my friend the Count of Monte
        Cristo has received into his house, and who is going to marry Mademoiselle
        Danglars?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Exactly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you suffer that, you wretch!&mdash;you, who know his life and
        his crime?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why should I stand in a comrade&rsquo;s way?&rdquo; said
        Caderousse.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are right; it is not you who should apprise M. Danglars, it is
        I.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do not do so, reverend sir.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because you would bring us to ruin.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you think that to save such villains as you I will become an
        abettor of their plot, an accomplice in their crimes?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Reverend sir,&rdquo; said Caderousse, drawing still nearer.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will expose all.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To whom?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To M. Danglars.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By Heaven!&rdquo; cried Caderousse, drawing from his waistcoat an
        open knife, and striking the count in the breast, &ldquo;you shall
        disclose nothing, reverend sir!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        To Caderousse&rsquo;s great astonishment, the knife, instead of piercing the
        count&rsquo;s breast, flew back blunted. At the same moment the count seized with
        his left hand the assassin&rsquo;s wrist, and wrung it with such strength that the
        knife fell from his stiffened fingers, and Caderousse uttered a cry of pain. But
        the count, disregarding his cry, continued to wring the bandit&rsquo;s
        wrist, until, his arm being dislocated, he fell first on his knees, then
        flat on the floor.
      </p>
      <p>
        The count then placed his foot on his head, saying, &ldquo;I know not what
        restrains me from crushing thy skull, rascal.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, mercy&mdash;mercy!&rdquo; cried Caderousse.
      </p>
      <p>
        The count withdrew his foot.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40162m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Rise!&rdquo; said he. Caderousse rose.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What a wrist you have, reverend sir!&rdquo; said Caderousse,
        stroking his arm, all bruised by the fleshy pincers which had held it;
        &ldquo;what a wrist!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Silence! God gives me strength to overcome a wild beast like you;
        in the name of that God I act,&mdash;remember that, wretch,&mdash;and to
        spare thee at this moment is still serving him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Caderousse, groaning with pain.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Take this pen and paper, and write what I dictate.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how to write, reverend sir.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You lie! Take this pen, and write!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Caderousse, awed by the superior power of the abbé, sat down and wrote:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&mdash;The man whom you are receiving at your house, and to whom you
        intend to marry your daughter, is a felon who escaped with me from
        confinement at Toulon. He was No. 59, and I No. 58. He was called
        Benedetto, but he is ignorant of his real name, having never known his
        parents.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sign it!&rdquo; continued the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But would you ruin me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If I sought your ruin, fool, I should drag you to the first
        guard-house; besides, when that note is delivered, in all probability you
        will have no more to fear. Sign it, then!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Caderousse signed it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The address, &lsquo;To monsieur the Baron Danglars, banker, Rue de la
        Chaussée d&rsquo;Antin.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Caderousse wrote the address. The abbé took the note.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that suffices&mdash;begone!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Which way?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The way you came.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You wish me to get out at that window?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You got in very well.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, you have some design against me, reverend sir.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Idiot! what design can I have?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, then, not let me out by the door?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What would be the advantage of waking the porter?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, reverend sir, tell me, do you wish me dead?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I wish what God wills.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But swear that you will not strike me as I go down.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Cowardly fool!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you intend doing with me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I ask you what can I do? I have tried to make you a happy man, and
        you have turned out a murderer.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, monsieur,&rdquo; said Caderousse, &ldquo;make one more attempt&mdash;try
        me once more!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said the count. &ldquo;Listen&mdash;you know if I
        may be relied on.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Caderousse.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If you arrive safely at home&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What have I to fear, except from you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If you reach your home safely, leave Paris, leave France, and
        wherever you may be, so long as you conduct yourself well, I will send you
        a small annuity; for, if you return home safely, then&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then?&rdquo; asked Caderousse, shuddering.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40164m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then I shall believe God has forgiven you, and I will forgive you
        too.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As true as I am a Christian,&rdquo; stammered Caderousse, &ldquo;you
        will make me die of fright!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now begone,&rdquo; said the count, pointing to the window.
      </p>
      <p>
        Caderousse, scarcely yet relying on this promise, put his legs out of the
        window and stood on the ladder.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now go down,&rdquo; said the abbé, folding his arms. Understanding he had
        nothing more to fear from him, Caderousse began to go down. Then the count brought
        the taper to the window, that it might be seen in the Champs-Élysées that a man
        was getting out of the window while another held a light.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What are you doing, reverend sir? Suppose a watchman should pass?&rdquo;
        And he blew out the light. He then descended, but it was only when he felt
        his foot touch the ground that he was satisfied of his safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo returned to his bedroom, and, glancing rapidly from the
        garden to the street, he saw first Caderousse, who after walking to the
        end of the garden, fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part
        from where he came in. The count then looking over into the street, saw
        the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction, and place
        himself against the angle of the wall where Caderousse would come over.
        Caderousse climbed the ladder slowly, and looked over the coping to see if
        the street was quiet. No one could be seen or heard. The clock of the
        Invalides struck one. Then Caderousse sat astride the coping, and drawing
        up his ladder passed it over the wall; then he began to descend, or rather
        to slide down by the two stanchions, which he did with an ease which
        proved how accustomed he was to the exercise. But, once started, he could
        not stop. In vain did he see a man start from the shadow when he was
        halfway down&mdash;in vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before he could defend himself that arm struck him so violently in
        the back that he let go the ladder, crying, &ldquo;Help!&rdquo; A second
        blow struck him almost immediately in the side, and he fell, calling,
        &ldquo;Help, murder!&rdquo; Then, as he rolled on the ground, his
        adversary seized him by the hair, and struck him a third blow in the chest.
      </p>
      <p>
        This time Caderousse endeavored to call again, but he could only
        utter a groan, and he shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds.
        The assassin, finding that he no longer cried out, lifted his head up by
        the hair; his eyes were closed, and the mouth was distorted. The murderer,
        supposing him dead, let fall his head and disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then Caderousse, feeling that he was leaving him, raised himself on his elbow, and
        with a dying voice cried with great effort:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Murder! I am dying! Help, reverend sir,&mdash;help!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        This mournful appeal pierced the darkness. The door of the back-staircase
        opened, then the side-gate of the garden, and Ali and his master were on
        the spot with lights.
