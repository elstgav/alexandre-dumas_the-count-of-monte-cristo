      <h2>Chapter 95. Father and Daughter</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e saw in a
        preceding chapter how Madame Danglars went formally to announce to Madame
        de Villefort the approaching marriage of Eugénie Danglars and M. Andrea
        Cavalcanti. This formal announcement, which implied or appeared to imply,
        the approval of all the persons concerned in this momentous affair, had
        been preceded by a scene to which our readers must be admitted. We beg
        them to take one step backward, and to transport themselves, the morning
        of that day of great catastrophes, into the showy, gilded salon we have
        before shown them, and which was the pride of its owner, Baron Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this room, at about ten o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the banker
        himself had been walking to and fro for some minutes thoughtfully and in
        evident uneasiness, watching both doors, and listening to every sound.
        When his patience was exhausted, he called his valet.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Étienne,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;see why Mademoiselle Eugénie has asked me
        to meet her in the drawing-room, and why she makes me wait so long.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Having given this vent to his ill-humor, the baron became more calm;
        Mademoiselle Danglars had that morning requested an interview with her
        father, and had fixed on the gilded drawing-room as the spot. The
        singularity of this step, and above all its formality, had not a little
        surprised the banker, who had immediately obeyed his daughter by repairing
        first to the drawing-room. Étienne soon returned from his errand.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mademoiselle&rsquo;s lady&rsquo;s maid says, sir, that mademoiselle is
        finishing her toilette, and will be here shortly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars nodded, to signify that he was satisfied. To the world and to his
        servants Danglars assumed the character of the good-natured man and the
        indulgent father. This was one of his parts in the popular comedy he was
        performing,&mdash;a make-up he had adopted and which suited him about as
        well as the masks worn on the classic stage by paternal actors, who seen
        from one side, were the image of geniality, and from the other showed lips
        drawn down in chronic ill-temper. Let us hasten to say that in private the
        genial side descended to the level of the other, so that generally the
        indulgent man disappeared to give place to the brutal husband and
        domineering father.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why the devil does that foolish girl, who pretends to wish to speak to me,
        not come into my study? and why on earth does she want to speak to me at all?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He was turning this thought over in his brain for the twentieth time, when
        the door opened and Eugénie appeared, attired in a figured black satin
        dress, her hair dressed and gloves on, as if she were going to the Italian Opera.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, Eugénie, what is it you want with me? and why in this solemn
        drawing-room when the study is so comfortable?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I quite understand why you ask, sir,&rdquo; said Eugénie, making a
        sign that her father might be seated, &ldquo;and in fact your two
        questions suggest fully the theme of our conversation. I will answer them
        both, and contrary to the usual method, the last first, because it is the
        least difficult. I have chosen the drawing-room, sir, as our place of
        meeting, in order to avoid the disagreeable impressions and influences of
        a banker&rsquo;s study. Those gilded cashbooks, drawers locked like gates
        of fortresses, heaps of bank-bills, come from I know not where, and the
        quantities of letters from England, Holland, Spain, India, China, and
        Peru, have generally a strange influence on a father&rsquo;s mind, and
        make him forget that there is in the world an interest greater and more
        sacred than the good opinion of his correspondents. I have, therefore,
        chosen this drawing-room, where you see, smiling and happy in their
        magnificent frames, your portrait, mine, my mother&rsquo;s, and all sorts
        of rural landscapes and touching pastorals. I rely much on external
        impressions; perhaps, with regard to you, they are immaterial, but I
        should be no artist if I had not some fancies.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied M. Danglars, who had listened to all this
        preamble with imperturbable coolness, but without understanding a word,
        since like every man burdened with thoughts of the past, he was occupied
        with seeking the thread of his own ideas in those of the speaker.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There is, then, the second point cleared up, or nearly so,&rdquo;
        said Eugénie, without the least confusion, and with that masculine
        pointedness which distinguished her gesture and her language; &ldquo;and
        you appear satisfied with the explanation. Now, let us return to the
        first. You ask me why I have requested this interview; I will tell you in
        two words, sir; I will not marry count Andrea Cavalcanti.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars leaped from his chair and raised his eyes and arms towards
        heaven.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40298m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, indeed, sir,&rdquo; continued Eugénie, still quite calm;
        &ldquo;you are astonished, I see; for since this little affair began, I
        have not manifested the slightest opposition, and yet I am always sure,
        when the opportunity arrives, to oppose a determined and absolute will to
        people who have not consulted me, and things which displease me. However,
        this time, my tranquillity, or passiveness as philosophers say, proceeded
        from another source; it proceeded from a wish, like a submissive and
        devoted daughter&rdquo; (a slight smile was observable on the purple lips
        of the young girl), &ldquo;to practice obedience.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; replied Eugénie, &ldquo;I have tried to the very
        last and now that the moment has come, I feel in spite of all my efforts
        that it is impossible.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Danglars, whose weak mind was at first quite
        overwhelmed with the weight of this pitiless logic, marking evident
        premeditation and force of will, &ldquo;what is your reason for this
        refusal, Eugénie? what reason do you assign?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My reason?&rdquo; replied the young girl. &ldquo;Well, it is not
        that the man is more ugly, more foolish, or more disagreeable than any
        other; no, M. Andrea Cavalcanti may appear to those who look at men&rsquo;s
        faces and figures as a very good specimen of his kind. It is not, either,
        that my heart is less touched by him than any other; that would be a
        schoolgirl&rsquo;s reason, which I consider quite beneath me. I actually
        love no one, sir; you know it, do you not? I do not then see why, without
        real necessity, I should encumber my life with a perpetual companion. Has
        not some sage said, &lsquo;Nothing too much&rsquo;? and another, &lsquo;I
        carry all my effects with me&rsquo;? I have been taught these two
        aphorisms in Latin and in Greek; one is, I believe, from Phædrus, and the
        other from Bias. Well, my dear father, in the shipwreck of life&mdash;for
        life is an eternal shipwreck of our hopes&mdash;I cast into the sea my
        useless encumbrance, that is all, and I remain with my own will, disposed
        to live perfectly alone, and consequently perfectly free.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Unhappy girl, unhappy girl!&rdquo; murmured Danglars, turning pale,
        for he knew from long experience the solidity of the obstacle he had so
        suddenly encountered.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Unhappy girl,&rdquo; replied Eugénie, &ldquo;unhappy girl, do you
        say, sir? No, indeed; the exclamation appears quite theatrical and
        affected. Happy, on the contrary, for what am I in want of? The world
        calls me beautiful. It is something to be well received. I like a
        favorable reception; it expands the countenance, and those around me do
        not then appear so ugly. I possess a share of wit, and a certain relative
        sensibility, which enables me to draw from life in general, for the
        support of mine, all I meet with that is good, like the monkey who cracks
        the nut to get at its contents. I am rich, for you have one of the first
        fortunes in France. I am your only daughter, and you are not so exacting
        as the fathers of the Porte Saint-Martin and Gaîté, who disinherit their
        daughters for not giving them grandchildren. Besides, the provident law
        has deprived you of the power to disinherit me, at least entirely, as it
        has also of the power to compel me to marry Monsieur This or Monsieur
        That. And so&mdash;being, beautiful, witty, somewhat talented, as the
        comic operas say, and rich&mdash;and that is happiness, sir&mdash;why do
        you call me unhappy?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars, seeing his daughter smiling, and proud even to insolence, could
        not entirely repress his brutal feelings, but they betrayed themselves
        only by an exclamation. Under the fixed and inquiring gaze levelled at him
        from under those beautiful black eyebrows, he prudently turned away, and
        calmed himself immediately, daunted by the power of a resolute mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Truly, my daughter,&rdquo; replied he with a smile, &ldquo;you are
        all you boast of being, excepting one thing; I will not too hastily tell
        you which, but would rather leave you to guess it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Eugénie looked at Danglars, much surprised that one flower of her crown of pride,
        with which she had so superbly decked herself, should be disputed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; continued the banker, &ldquo;you have perfectly
        explained to me the sentiments which influence a girl like you, who is determined
        she will not marry; now it remains for me to tell you the motives of a
        father like me, who has decided that his daughter shall marry.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Eugénie bowed, not as a submissive daughter, but as an adversary prepared
        for a discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My daughter,&rdquo; continued Danglars, &ldquo;when a father asks
        his daughter to choose a husband, he has always some reason for wishing
        her to marry. Some are affected with the mania of which you spoke just
        now, that of living again in their grandchildren. This is not my weakness,
        I tell you at once; family joys have no charm for me. I may acknowledge
        this to a daughter whom I know to be philosophical enough to understand my
        indifference, and not to impute it to me as a crime.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This is not to the purpose,&rdquo; said Eugénie; &ldquo;let us
        speak candidly, sir; I admire candor.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Danglars, &ldquo;I can, when circumstances render
        it desirable, adopt your system, although it may not be my general
        practice. I will therefore proceed. I have proposed to you to marry, not
        for your sake, for indeed I did not think of you in the least at the
        moment (you admire candor, and will now be satisfied, I hope); but because
        it suited me to marry you as soon as possible, on account of certain
        commercial speculations I am desirous of entering into.&rdquo; Eugénie
        became uneasy.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/40302m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is just as I tell you, I assure you, and you must not be angry
        with me, for you have sought this disclosure. I do not willingly enter
        into arithmetical explanations with an artist like you, who fears to enter
        my study lest she should imbibe disagreeable or anti-poetic impressions
        and sensations. But in that same banker&rsquo;s study, where you very
        willingly presented yourself yesterday to ask for the thousand francs I
        give you monthly for pocket-money, you must know, my dear young lady, that
        many things may be learned, useful even to a girl who will not marry.
        There one may learn, for instance, what, out of regard to your nervous
        susceptibility, I will inform you of in the drawing-room, namely, that the
        credit of a banker is his physical and moral life; that credit sustains
        him as breath animates the body; and M. de Monte Cristo once gave me a
        lecture on that subject, which I have never forgotten. There we may learn
        that as credit sinks, the body becomes a corpse, and this is what must
        happen very soon to the banker who is proud to own so good a logician as
        you for his daughter.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        But Eugénie, instead of stooping, drew herself up under the blow.
        &ldquo;Ruined?&rdquo; said she.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Exactly, my daughter; that is precisely what I mean,&rdquo; said
        Danglars, almost digging his nails into his breast, while he preserved on
        his harsh features the smile of the heartless though clever man; &ldquo;ruined&mdash;yes,
        that is it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Eugénie.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, ruined! Now it is revealed, this secret so full of horror, as
        the tragic poet says. Now, my daughter, learn from my lips how you may
        alleviate this misfortune, so far as it will affect you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried Eugénie, &ldquo;you are a bad physiognomist, if
        you imagine I deplore on my own account the catastrophe of which you warn
        me. I ruined? and what will that signify to me? Have I not my talent left?
        Can I not, like Pasta, Malibran, Grisi, acquire for myself what you would
        never have given me, whatever might have been your fortune, a hundred or a
        hundred and fifty thousand livres per annum, for which I shall be indebted
        to no one but myself; and which, instead of being given as you gave me
        those poor twelve thousand francs, with sour looks and reproaches for my
        prodigality, will be accompanied with acclamations, with bravos, and with
        flowers? And if I do not possess that talent, which your smiles prove to
        me you doubt, should I not still have that ardent love of independence,
        which will be a substitute for wealth, and which in my mind supersedes
        even the instinct of self-preservation? No, I grieve not on my own
        account, I shall always find a resource; my books, my pencils, my piano,
        all the things which cost but little, and which I shall be able to
        procure, will remain my own.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you think that I sorrow for Madame Danglars? Undeceive yourself
        again; either I am greatly mistaken, or she has provided against the
        catastrophe which threatens you, and, which will pass over without
        affecting her. She has taken care for herself,&mdash;at least I hope so,&mdash;for
        her attention has not been diverted from her projects by watching over me.
        She has fostered my independence by professedly indulging my love for
        liberty. Oh, no, sir; from my childhood I have seen too much, and
        understood too much, of what has passed around me, for misfortune to have
        an undue power over me. From my earliest recollections, I have been
        beloved by no one&mdash;so much the worse; that has naturally led me to
        love no one&mdash;so much the better&mdash;now you have my profession of
        faith.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Danglars, pale with anger, which was not at all
        due to offended paternal love,&mdash;&ldquo;then, mademoiselle, you
        persist in your determination to accelerate my ruin?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your ruin? I accelerate your ruin? What do you mean? I do not
        understand you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So much the better, I have a ray of hope left; listen.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am all attention,&rdquo; said Eugénie, looking so earnestly at
        her father that it was an effort for the latter to endure her unrelenting
        gaze.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. Cavalcanti,&rdquo; continued Danglars, &ldquo;is about to marry
        you, and will place in my hands his fortune, amounting to three million
        livres.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is admirable!&rdquo; said Eugénie with sovereign contempt,
        smoothing her gloves out one upon the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You think I shall deprive you of those three millions,&rdquo; said
        Danglars; &ldquo;but do not fear it. They are destined to produce at least
        ten. I and a brother banker have obtained a grant of a railway, the only
        industrial enterprise which in these days promises to make good the
        fabulous prospects that Law once held out to the eternally deluded
        Parisians, in the fantastic Mississippi scheme. As I look at it, a
        millionth part of a railway is worth fully as much as an acre of waste
        land on the banks of the Ohio. We make in our case a deposit, on a
        mortgage, which is an advance, as you see, since we gain at least ten,
        fifteen, twenty, or a hundred livres&rsquo; worth of iron in exchange for
        our money. Well, within a week I am to deposit four millions for my share;
        the four millions, I promise you, will produce ten or twelve.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But during my visit to you the day before yesterday, sir, which you
        appear to recollect so well,&rdquo; replied Eugénie, &ldquo;I saw you
        arranging a deposit&mdash;is not that the term?&mdash;of five millions and
        a half; you even pointed it out to me in two drafts on the treasury, and
        you were astonished that so valuable a paper did not dazzle my eyes like
        lightning.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but those five millions and a half are not mine, and are only
        a proof of the great confidence placed in me; my title of popular banker
        has gained me the confidence of charitable institutions, and the five
        millions and a half belong to them; at any other time I should not have
        hesitated to make use of them, but the great losses I have recently
        sustained are well known, and, as I told you, my credit is rather shaken.
        That deposit may be at any moment withdrawn, and if I had employed it for
        another purpose, I should bring on me a disgraceful bankruptcy. I do not
        despise bankruptcies, believe me, but they must be those which enrich, not
        those which ruin. Now, if you marry M. Cavalcanti, and I get the three
        millions, or even if it is thought I am going to get them, my credit will
        be restored, and my fortune, which for the last month or two has been
        swallowed up in gulfs which have been opened in my path by an
        inconceivable fatality, will revive. Do you understand me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Perfectly; you pledge me for three millions, do you not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The greater the amount, the more flattering it is to you; it gives
        you an idea of your value.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you. One word more, sir; do you promise me to make what use
        you can of the report of the fortune M. Cavalcanti will bring without
        touching the money? This is no act of selfishness, but of delicacy. I am
        willing to help rebuild your fortune, but I will not be an accomplice in
        the ruin of others.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But since I tell you,&rdquo; cried Danglars, &ldquo;that with these
        three million&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you expect to recover your position, sir, without touching those
        three million?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I hope so, if the marriage should take place and confirm my credit.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall you be able to pay M. Cavalcanti the five hundred thousand
        francs you promise for my dowry?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He shall receive them on returning from the
        mayor&rsquo;s<a href="#linknote-20" name="linknoteref-20" id="linknoteref-20">20</a>.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What next? what more do you want?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I wish to know if, in demanding my signature, you leave me entirely
        free in my person?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo;

      <p>
        &ldquo;Then, as I said before, sir,&mdash;very well; I am ready to marry
        M. Cavalcanti.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But what are you up to?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, that is my affair. What advantage should I have over you, if
        knowing your secret I were to tell you mine?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars bit his lips. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you are ready
        to pay the official visits, which are absolutely indispensable?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Eugénie.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And to sign the contract in three days?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then, in my turn, I also say, very well!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars pressed his daughter&rsquo;s hand in his. But, extraordinary to relate,
        the father did not say, &ldquo;Thank you, my child,&rdquo; nor did the daughter
        smile at her father.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is the conference ended?&rdquo; asked Eugénie, rising.
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars motioned that he had nothing more to say. Five minutes afterwards
        the piano resounded to the touch of Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Armilly&rsquo;s
        fingers, and Mademoiselle Danglars was singing Brabantio&rsquo;s
        malediction on Desdemona. At the end of the piece Étienne entered, and
        announced to Eugénie that the horses were to the carriage, and that the
        baroness was waiting for her to pay her visits. We have seen them at
        Villefort&rsquo;s; they proceeded then on their course.
