      <h2>Chapter 19. The Third Attack</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ow that this
        treasure, which had so long been the object of the abbé&rsquo;s
        meditations, could insure the future happiness of him whom Faria really
        loved as a son, it had doubled its value in his eyes, and every day he
        expatiated on the amount, explaining to Dantès all the good which, with
        thirteen or fourteen millions of francs, a man could do in these days to
        his friends; and then Dantès&rsquo; countenance became gloomy, for the
        oath of vengeance he had taken recurred to his memory, and he reflected
        how much ill, in these times, a man with thirteen or fourteen millions
        could do to his enemies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The abbé did not know the Island of Monte Cristo; but Dantès knew it, and
        had often passed it, situated twenty-five miles from Pianosa, between
        Corsica and the Island of Elba, and had once touched there. This island
        was, always had been, and still is, completely deserted. It is a rock of
        almost conical form, which looks as though it had been thrust up by
        volcanic force from the depth to the surface of the ocean. Dantès drew a
        plan of the island for Faria, and Faria gave Dantès advice as to the means
        he should employ to recover the treasure. But Dantès was far from being as
        enthusiastic and confident as the old man. It was past a question now that
        Faria was not a lunatic, and the way in which he had achieved the
        discovery, which had given rise to the suspicion of his madness, increased
        Edmond&rsquo;s admiration of him; but at the same time Dantès could not
        believe that the deposit, supposing it had ever existed, still existed;
        and though he considered the treasure as by no means chimerical, he yet
        believed it was no longer there.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as if fate resolved on depriving the prisoners of their last
        chance, and making them understand that they were condemned to perpetual
        imprisonment, a new misfortune befell them; the gallery on the sea side,
        which had long been in ruins, was rebuilt. They had repaired it
        completely, and stopped up with vast masses of stone the hole Dantès had
        partly filled in. But for this precaution, which, it will be remembered,
        the abbé had made to Edmond, the misfortune would have been still greater,
        for their attempt to escape would have been detected, and they would
        undoubtedly have been separated. Thus a new, a stronger, and more
        inexorable barrier was interposed to cut off the realization of their
        hopes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the young man, with an air of sorrowful
        resignation, to Faria, &ldquo;that God deems it right to take from me any
        claim to merit for what you call my devotion to you. I have promised to
        remain forever with you, and now I could not break my promise if I would.
        The treasure will be no more mine than yours, and neither of us will quit
        this prison. But my real treasure is not that, my dear friend, which
        awaits me beneath the sombre rocks of Monte Cristo, it is your presence,
        our living together five or six hours a day, in spite of our jailers; it
        is the rays of intelligence you have elicited from my brain, the languages
        you have implanted in my memory, and which have taken root there with all
        their philological ramifications. These different sciences that you have
        made so easy to me by the depth of the knowledge you possess of them, and
        the clearness of the principles to which you have reduced them&mdash;this
        is my treasure, my beloved friend, and with this you have made me rich and
        happy. Believe me, and take comfort, this is better for me than tons of
        gold and cases of diamonds, even were they not as problematical as the
        clouds we see in the morning floating over the sea, which we take for <i>terra
        firma</i>, and which evaporate and vanish as we draw near to them. To have
        you as long as possible near me, to hear your eloquent speech,&mdash;which
        embellishes my mind, strengthens my soul, and makes my whole frame capable
        of great and terrible things, if I should ever be free,&mdash;so fills my
        whole existence, that the despair to which I was just on the point of
        yielding when I knew you, has no longer any hold over me; and this&mdash;this
        is my fortune&mdash;not chimerical, but actual. I owe you my real good, my
        present happiness; and all the sovereigns of the earth, even Cæsar Borgia
        himself, could not deprive me of this.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, if not actually happy, yet the days these two unfortunates passed
        together went quickly. Faria, who for so long a time had kept silence as
        to the treasure, now perpetually talked of it. As he had prophesied would
        be the case, he remained paralyzed in the right arm and the left leg, and
        had given up all hope of ever enjoying it himself. But he was continually
        thinking over some means of escape for his young companion, and
        anticipating the pleasure he would enjoy. For fear the letter might be
        some day lost or stolen, he compelled Dantès to learn it by heart; and
        Dantès knew it from the first to the last word. Then he destroyed the
        second portion, assured that if the first were seized, no one would be
        able to discover its real meaning. Whole hours sometimes passed while
        Faria was giving instructions to Dantès,&mdash;instructions which were to
        serve him when he was at liberty. Then, once free, from the day and hour
        and moment when he was so, he could have but one only thought, which was,
        to gain Monte Cristo by some means, and remain there alone under some
        pretext which would arouse no suspicions; and once there, to endeavor to
        find the wonderful caverns, and search in the appointed spot,&mdash;the
        appointed spot, be it remembered, being the farthest angle in the second
        opening.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the meanwhile the hours passed, if not rapidly, at least tolerably.
        Faria, as we have said, without having recovered the use of his hand and
        foot, had regained all the clearness of his understanding, and had
        gradually, besides the moral instructions we have detailed, taught his
        youthful companion the patient and sublime duty of a prisoner, who learns
        to make something from nothing. They were thus perpetually employed,&mdash;Faria,
        that he might not see himself grow old; Dantès, for fear of recalling the
        almost extinct past which now only floated in his memory like a distant
        light wandering in the night. So life went on for them as it does for
        those who are not victims of misfortune and whose activities glide along
        mechanically and tranquilly beneath the eye of Providence.
      </p>
      <p>
        But beneath this superficial calm there were in the heart of the young
        man, and perhaps in that of the old man, many repressed desires, many
        stifled sighs, which found vent when Faria was left alone, and when Edmond
        returned to his cell.
      </p>
      <p>
        One night Edmond awoke suddenly, believing that he heard someone calling him.
        He opened his eyes upon utter darkness. His name, or rather a plaintive voice
        which essayed to pronounce his name, reached him. He sat up in bed and a cold
        sweat broke out upon his brow. Undoubtedly the call came from Faria&rsquo;s
        dungeon.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; murmured Edmond; &ldquo;can it be?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He moved his bed, drew up the stone, rushed into the passage, and reached
        the opposite extremity; the secret entrance was open. By the light of the
        wretched and wavering lamp, of which we have spoken, Dantès saw the old
        man, pale, but yet erect, clinging to the bedstead. His features were
        writhing with those horrible symptoms which he already knew, and which had
        so seriously alarmed him when he saw them for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas, my dear friend,&rdquo; said Faria in a resigned tone, &ldquo;you
        understand, do you not, and I need not attempt to explain to you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Edmond uttered a cry of agony, and, quite out of his senses, rushed
        towards the door, exclaiming, &ldquo;Help, help!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Faria had just sufficient strength to restrain him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Silence,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;or you are lost. We must now only
        think of you, my dear friend, and so act as to render your captivity
        supportable or your flight possible. It would require years to do again
        what I have done here, and the results would be instantly destroyed if our
        jailers knew we had communicated with each other. Besides, be assured, my
        dear Edmond, the dungeon I am about to leave will not long remain empty;
        some other unfortunate being will soon take my place, and to him you will
        appear like an angel of salvation. Perhaps he will be young, strong, and
        enduring, like yourself, and will aid you in your escape, while I have
        been but a hindrance. You will no longer have half a dead body tied to you
        as a drag to all your movements. At length Providence has done something
        for you; he restores to you more than he takes away, and it was time I
        should die.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Edmond could only clasp his hands and exclaim, &ldquo;Oh, my friend, my
        friend, speak not thus!&rdquo; and then resuming all his presence of mind,
        which had for a moment staggered under this blow, and his strength, which
        had failed at the words of the old man, he said, &ldquo;Oh, I have saved
        you once, and I will save you a second time!&rdquo; And raising the foot
        of the bed, he drew out the phial, still a third filled with the red
        liquor.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;See,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;there remains still some of the
        magic draught. Quick, quick! tell me what I must do this time; are there
        any fresh instructions? Speak, my friend; I listen.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There is not a hope,&rdquo; replied Faria, shaking his head,
        &ldquo;but no matter; God wills it that man whom he has created, and in
        whose heart he has so profoundly rooted the love of life, should do all in
        his power to preserve that existence, which, however painful it may be, is
        yet always so dear.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, yes!&rdquo; exclaimed Dantès; &ldquo;and I tell you that I
        will save you yet.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, try. The cold gains upon me. I feel the blood flowing
        towards my brain. These horrible chills, which make my teeth chatter and
        seem to dislocate my bones, begin to pervade my whole frame; in five
        minutes the malady will reach its height, and in a quarter of an hour
        there will be nothing left of me but a corpse.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Dantès, his heart wrung with anguish.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do as you did before, only do not wait so long, all the springs of
        life are now exhausted in me, and death,&rdquo; he continued, looking at
        his paralyzed arm and leg, &ldquo;has but half its work to do. If, after
        having made me swallow twelve drops instead of ten, you see that I do not
        recover, then pour the rest down my throat. Now lift me on my bed, for I
        can no longer support myself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Edmond took the old man in his arms, and laid him on the bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And now, my dear friend,&rdquo; said Faria, &ldquo;sole consolation
        of my wretched existence,&mdash;you whom Heaven gave me somewhat late, but
        still gave me, a priceless gift, and for which I am most grateful,&mdash;at
        the moment of separating from you forever, I wish you all the happiness
        and all the prosperity you so well deserve. My son, I bless thee!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The young man cast himself on his knees, leaning his head against the old
        man&rsquo;s bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen, now, to what I say in this my dying moment. The treasure of
        the Spadas exists. God grants me the boon of vision unrestricted by time
        or space. I see it in the depths of the inner cavern. My eyes pierce the
        inmost recesses of the earth, and are dazzled at the sight of so much
        riches. If you do escape, remember that the poor abbé, whom all the world
        called mad, was not so. Hasten to Monte Cristo&mdash;avail yourself of the
        fortune&mdash;for you have indeed suffered long enough.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        A violent convulsion attacked the old man. Dantès raised his head and saw
        Faria&rsquo;s eyes injected with blood. It seemed as if a flow of blood
        had ascended from the chest to the head.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Adieu, adieu!&rdquo; murmured the old man, clasping Edmond&rsquo;s
        hand convulsively&mdash;&ldquo;adieu!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no,&mdash;no, not yet,&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;do not forsake
        me! Oh, succor him! Help&mdash;help&mdash;help!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Hush! hush!&rdquo; murmured the dying man, &ldquo;that they
        may not separate us if you save me!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are right. Oh, yes, yes; be assured I shall save you! Besides,
        although you suffer much, you do not seem to be in such agony as you were
        before.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do not mistake! I suffer less because there is in me less strength
        to endure. At your age we have faith in life; it is the privilege of youth
        to believe and hope, but old men see death more clearly. Oh, &rsquo;tis
        here&mdash;&rsquo;tis here&mdash;&rsquo;tis over&mdash;my sight is gone&mdash;my
        senses fail! Your hand, Dantès! Adieu! adieu!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And raising himself by a final effort, in which he summoned all his faculties,
        he said,&mdash;&ldquo;Monte Cristo, forget not Monte Cristo!&rdquo; And he
        fell back on the bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The crisis was terrible, and a rigid form with twisted limbs, swollen eyelids,
        and lips flecked with bloody foam, lay on the bed of torture, in place of the
        intellectual being who so lately rested there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dantès took the lamp, placed it on a projecting stone above the bed,
        whence its tremulous light fell with strange and fantastic ray on the
        distorted countenance and motionless, stiffened body. With steady gaze he
        awaited confidently the moment for administering the restorative.
      </p>
      <p>
        When he believed that the right moment had arrived, he took the knife,
        pried open the teeth, which offered less resistance than before, counted
        one after the other twelve drops, and watched; the phial contained,
        perhaps, twice as much more. He waited ten minutes, a quarter of an hour,
        half an hour,&mdash;no change took place. Trembling, his hair erect, his
        brow bathed with perspiration, he counted the seconds by the beating of
        his heart. Then he thought it was time to make the last trial, and he put
        the phial to the purple lips of Faria, and without having occasion to
        force open his jaws, which had remained extended, he poured the whole of
        the liquid down his throat.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0255m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        The draught produced a galvanic effect, a violent trembling pervaded the
        old man&rsquo;s limbs, his eyes opened until it was fearful to gaze upon
        them, he heaved a sigh which resembled a shriek, and then his convulsed
        body returned gradually to its former immobility, the eyes remaining open.
      </p>
      <p>
        Half an hour, an hour, an hour and a half elapsed, and during this period
        of anguish, Edmond leaned over his friend, his hand applied to his heart,
        and felt the body gradually grow cold, and the heart&rsquo;s pulsation
        become more and more deep and dull, until at length it stopped; the last
        movement of the heart ceased, the face became livid, the eyes remained
        open, but the eyeballs were glazed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was six o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the dawn was just breaking, and
        its feeble ray came into the dungeon, and paled the ineffectual light of
        the lamp. Strange shadows passed over the countenance of the dead man, and
        at times gave it the appearance of life. While the struggle between day
        and night lasted, Dantès still doubted; but as soon as the daylight gained
        the pre-eminence, he saw that he was alone with a corpse. Then an
        invincible and extreme terror seized upon him, and he dared not again
        press the hand that hung out of bed, he dared no longer to gaze on those
        fixed and vacant eyes, which he tried many times to close, but in vain&mdash;they
        opened again as soon as shut. He extinguished the lamp, carefully
        concealed it, and then went away, closing as well as he could the entrance
        to the secret passage by the large stone as he descended.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was time, for the jailer was coming. On this occasion he began his
        rounds at Dantès&rsquo; cell, and on leaving him he went on to Faria&rsquo;s
        dungeon, taking thither breakfast and some linen. Nothing betokened that
        the man knew anything of what had occurred. He went on his way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dantès was then seized with an indescribable desire to know what was going
        on in the dungeon of his unfortunate friend. He therefore returned by the
        subterraneous gallery, and arrived in time to hear the exclamations of the
        turnkey, who called out for help. Other turnkeys came, and then was heard
        the regular tramp of soldiers. Last of all came the governor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edmond heard the creaking of the bed as they moved the corpse, heard the
        voice of the governor, who asked them to throw water on the dead man&rsquo;s
        face; and seeing that, in spite of this application, the prisoner did not
        recover, they sent for the doctor. The governor then went out, and words
        of pity fell on Dantès&rsquo; listening ears, mingled with brutal
        laughter.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;the madman has gone to look
        after his treasure. Good journey to him!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With all his millions, he will not have enough to pay for his
        shroud!&rdquo; said another.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; added a third voice, &ldquo;the shrouds of the Château d&rsquo;If
        are not dear!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0257m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; said one of the previous speakers, &ldquo;as he was
        a churchman, they may go to some expense in his behalf.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They may give him the honors of the sack.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Edmond did not lose a word, but comprehended very little of what was said.
        The voices soon ceased, and it seemed to him as if everyone had left the
        cell. Still he dared not to enter, as they might have left some turnkey to
        watch the dead. He remained, therefore, mute and motionless, hardly
        venturing to breathe. At the end of an hour, he heard a faint noise, which
        increased. It was the governor who returned, followed by the doctor and
        other attendants. There was a moment&rsquo;s silence,&mdash;it was evident
        that the doctor was examining the dead body. The inquiries soon commenced.
      </p>
      <p>
        The doctor analyzed the symptoms of the malady to which the prisoner had
        succumbed, and declared that he was dead. Questions and answers followed
        in a nonchalant manner that made Dantès indignant, for he felt that all
        the world should have for the poor abbé a love and respect equal to his
        own.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am very sorry for what you tell me,&rdquo; said the governor,
        replying to the assurance of the doctor, &ldquo;that the old man is really
        dead; for he was a quiet, inoffensive prisoner, happy in his folly, and
        required no watching.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; added the turnkey, &ldquo;there was no occasion for
        watching him; he would have stayed here fifty years, I&rsquo;ll answer for
        it, without any attempt to escape.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Still,&rdquo; said the governor, &ldquo;I believe it will be
        requisite, notwithstanding your certainty, and not that I doubt your
        science, but in discharge of my official duty, that we should be perfectly
        assured that the prisoner is dead.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a moment of complete silence, during which Dantès, still listening,
        knew that the doctor was examining the corpse a second time.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You may make your mind easy,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;he is
        dead. I will answer for that.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You know, sir,&rdquo; said the governor, persisting, &ldquo;that we
        are not content in such cases as this with such a simple examination. In
        spite of all appearances, be so kind, therefore, as to finish your duty by
        fulfilling the formalities described by law.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let the irons be heated,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;but really
        it is a useless precaution.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        This order to heat the irons made Dantès shudder. He heard hasty steps, the
        creaking of a door, people going and coming, and some minutes afterwards a
        turnkey entered, saying:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Here is the brazier, lighted.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a moment&rsquo;s silence, and then was heard the crackling of burning
        flesh, of which the peculiar and nauseous smell penetrated even behind the wall
        where Dantès was listening in horror. The perspiration poured forth upon the
        young man&rsquo;s brow, and he felt as if he should faint.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You see, sir, he is really dead,&rdquo; said the doctor; &ldquo;this
        burn in the heel is decisive. The poor fool is cured of his folly, and
        delivered from his captivity.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t his name Faria?&rdquo; inquired one of the officers
        who accompanied the governor.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0259m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, sir; and, as he said, it was an ancient name. He was, too,
        very learned, and rational enough on all points which did not relate to
        his treasure; but on that, indeed, he was intractable.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is the sort of malady which we call monomania,&rdquo; said the
        doctor.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You had never anything to complain of?&rdquo; said the governor to
        the jailer who had charge of the abbé.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Never, sir,&rdquo; replied the jailer, &ldquo;never; on the
        contrary, he sometimes amused me very much by telling me stories. One day,
        too, when my wife was ill, he gave me a prescription which cured her.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, ah!&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;I did not know that I had a
        rival; but I hope, governor, that you will show him all proper respect
        in consequence.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, make your mind easy, he shall be decently interred in the
        newest sack we can find. Will that satisfy you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Must this last formality take place in your presence, sir?&rdquo;
        inquired a turnkey.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly. But make haste&mdash;I cannot stay here all day.&rdquo;
        Other footsteps, going and coming, were now heard, and a moment afterwards
        the noise of rustling canvas reached Dantès&rsquo; ears, the bed creaked,
        and the heavy footfall of a man who lifts a weight sounded on the floor;
        then the bed again creaked under the weight deposited upon it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This evening,&rdquo; said the governor.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Will there be any mass?&rdquo; asked one of the attendants.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is impossible,&rdquo; replied the governor. &ldquo;The
        chaplain of the château came to me yesterday to beg for leave of absence,
        in order to take a trip to Hyères for a week. I told him I would attend to
        the prisoners in his absence. If the poor abbé had not been in such a
        hurry, he might have had his requiem.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Pooh, pooh;&rdquo; said the doctor, with the impiety usual in
        persons of his profession; &ldquo;he is a churchman. God will respect his
        profession, and not give the devil the wicked delight of sending him a
        priest.&rdquo; A shout of laughter followed this brutal jest. Meanwhile
        the operation of putting the body in the sack was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This evening,&rdquo; said the governor, when the task was ended.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At what hour?&rdquo; inquired a turnkey.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, about ten or eleven o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall we watch by the corpse?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of what use would it be? Shut the dungeon as if he were alive&mdash;that
        is all.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the steps retreated, and the voices died away in the distance; the noise of
        the door, with its creaking hinges and bolts ceased, and a silence more sombre
        than that of solitude ensued,&mdash;the silence of death, which was all-pervasive,
        and struck its icy chill to the very soul of Dantès.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then he raised the flag-stone cautiously with his head, and looked carefully
        around the chamber. It was empty, and Dantès emerged from the tunnel.
