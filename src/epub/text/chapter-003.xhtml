      <h2>Chapter 3. The Catalans</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>eyond a bare,
        weather-worn wall, about a hundred paces from the spot where the two
        friends sat looking and listening as they drank their wine, was the
        village of the Catalans. Long ago this mysterious colony quitted Spain,
        and settled on the tongue of land on which it is to this day. Whence it
        came no one knew, and it spoke an unknown tongue. One of its chiefs, who
        understood Provençal, begged the commune of Marseilles to give them this
        bare and barren promontory, where, like the sailors of old, they had run
        their boats ashore. The request was granted; and three months afterwards,
        around the twelve or fifteen small vessels which had brought these gypsies
        of the sea, a small village sprang up. This village, constructed in a
        singular and picturesque manner, half Moorish, half Spanish, still
        remains, and is inhabited by descendants of the first comers, who speak
        the language of their fathers. For three or four centuries they have
        remained upon this small promontory, on which they had settled like a
        flight of seabirds, without mixing with the Marseillaise population,
        intermarrying, and preserving their original customs and the costume of
        their mother-country as they have preserved its language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our readers will follow us along the only street of this little village,
        and enter with us one of the houses, which is sunburned to the beautiful
        dead-leaf color peculiar to the buildings of the country, and within
        coated with whitewash, like a Spanish posada. A young and beautiful girl,
        with hair as black as jet, her eyes as velvety as the gazelle&rsquo;s, was
        leaning with her back against the wainscot, rubbing in her slender
        delicately moulded fingers a bunch of heath blossoms, the flowers of which
        she was picking off and strewing on the floor; her arms, bare to the
        elbow, brown, and modelled after those of the Arlesian Venus, moved with a
        kind of restless impatience, and she tapped the earth with her arched and
        supple foot, so as to display the pure and full shape of her well-turned
        leg, in its red cotton, gray and blue clocked, stocking. At three paces
        from her, seated in a chair which he balanced on two legs, leaning his
        elbow on an old worm-eaten table, was a tall young man of twenty, or
        two-and-twenty, who was looking at her with an air in which vexation and
        uneasiness were mingled. He questioned her with his eyes, but the firm and
        steady gaze of the young girl controlled his look.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You see, Mercédès,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;here is Easter
        come round again; tell me, is this the moment for a wedding?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have answered you a hundred times, Fernand, and really you must
        be very stupid to ask me again.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, repeat it,&mdash;repeat it, I beg of you, that I may at last
        believe it! Tell me for the hundredth time that you refuse my love, which
        had your mother&rsquo;s sanction. Make me understand once for all that you
        are trifling with my happiness, that my life or death are nothing to you.
        Ah, to have dreamed for ten years of being your husband, Mercédès, and to
        lose that hope, which was the only stay of my existence!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At least it was not I who ever encouraged you in that hope,
        Fernand,&rdquo; replied Mercédès; &ldquo;you cannot reproach me with the
        slightest coquetry. I have always said to you, &lsquo;I love you as a
        brother; but do not ask from me more than sisterly affection, for my heart
        is another&rsquo;s.&rsquo; Is not this true, Fernand?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, that is very true, Mercédès,&rdquo; replied the young man,
        &ldquo;Yes, you have been cruelly frank with me; but do you forget that it
        is among the Catalans a sacred law to intermarry?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0045m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You mistake, Fernand; it is not a law, but merely a custom, and, I
        pray of you, do not cite this custom in your favor. You are included in
        the conscription, Fernand, and are only at liberty on sufferance, liable
        at any moment to be called upon to take up arms. Once a soldier, what
        would you do with me, a poor orphan, forlorn, without fortune, with
        nothing but a half-ruined hut and a few ragged nets, the miserable
        inheritance left by my father to my mother, and by my mother to me? She
        has been dead a year, and you know, Fernand, I have subsisted almost
        entirely on public charity. Sometimes you pretend I am useful to you, and
        that is an excuse to share with me the produce of your fishing, and I
        accept it, Fernand, because you are the son of my father&rsquo;s brother,
        because we were brought up together, and still more because it would give
        you so much pain if I refuse. But I feel very deeply that this fish which
        I go and sell, and with the produce of which I buy the flax I spin,&mdash;I
        feel very keenly, Fernand, that this is charity.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And if it were, Mercédès, poor and lone as you are, you suit me as
        well as the daughter of the first shipowner or the richest banker of
        Marseilles! What do such as we desire but a good wife and careful
        housekeeper, and where can I look for these better than in you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Fernand,&rdquo; answered Mercédès, shaking her head, &ldquo;a woman
        becomes a bad manager, and who shall say she will remain an honest woman,
        when she loves another man better than her husband? Rest content with my
        friendship, for I say once more that is all I can promise, and I will
        promise no more than I can bestow.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; replied Fernand, &ldquo;you can endure your
        own wretchedness patiently, but you are afraid to share mine. Well,
        Mercédès, beloved by you, I would tempt fortune; you would bring me good
        luck, and I should become rich. I could extend my occupation as a
        fisherman, might get a place as clerk in a warehouse, and become in time a
        dealer myself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You could do no such thing, Fernand; you are a soldier, and if you
        remain at the Catalans it is because there is no war; so remain a
        fisherman, and contented with my friendship, as I cannot give you more.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I will do better, Mercédès. I will be a sailor; instead of
        the costume of our fathers, which you despise, I will wear a varnished
        hat, a striped shirt, and a blue jacket, with an anchor on the buttons.
        Would not that dress please you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Mercédès, with an angry glance,&mdash;&ldquo;what
        do you mean? I do not understand you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I mean, Mercédès, that you are thus harsh and cruel with me,
        because you are expecting someone who is thus attired; but perhaps he whom
        you await is inconstant, or if he is not, the sea is so to him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Fernand,&rdquo; cried Mercédès, &ldquo;I believed you were
        good-hearted, and I was mistaken! Fernand, you are wicked to call to your
        aid jealousy and the anger of God! Yes, I will not deny it, I do await,
        and I do love him of whom you speak; and, if he does not return, instead
        of accusing him of the inconstancy which you insinuate, I will tell you
        that he died loving me and me only.&rdquo; The young girl made a gesture
        of rage. &ldquo;I understand you, Fernand; you would be revenged on him
        because I do not love you; you would cross your Catalan knife with his
        dirk. What end would that answer? To lose you my friendship if he were
        conquered, and see that friendship changed into hate if you were victor.
        Believe me, to seek a quarrel with a man is a bad method of pleasing the
        woman who loves that man. No, Fernand, you will not thus give way to evil
        thoughts. Unable to have me for your wife, you will content yourself with
        having me for your friend and sister; and besides,&rdquo; she added, her
        eyes troubled and moistened with tears, &ldquo;wait, wait, Fernand; you
        said just now that the sea was treacherous, and he has been gone four
        months, and during these four months there have been some terrible storms.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Fernand made no reply, nor did he attempt to check the tears which flowed
        down the cheeks of Mercédès, although for each of these tears he would
        have shed his heart&rsquo;s blood; but these tears flowed for another. He
        arose, paced a while up and down the hut, and then, suddenly stopping
        before Mercédès, with his eyes glowing and his hands clenched,&mdash;&ldquo;Say,
        Mercédès,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;once for all, is this your final
        determination?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I love Edmond Dantès,&rdquo; the young girl calmly replied, &ldquo;and
        none but Edmond shall ever be my husband.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you will always love him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As long as I live.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Fernand let fall his head like a defeated man, heaved a sigh that was like
        a groan, and then suddenly looking her full in the face, with clenched
        teeth and expanded nostrils, said,&mdash;&ldquo;But if he is dead&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If he is dead, I shall die too.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If he has forgotten you&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mercédès!&rdquo; called a joyous voice from without,&mdash;&ldquo;Mercédès!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; exclaimed the young girl, blushing with delight, and
        fairly leaping in excess of love, &ldquo;you see he has not forgotten me,
        for here he is!&rdquo; And rushing towards the door, she opened it,
        saying, &ldquo;Here, Edmond, here I am!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Fernand, pale and trembling, drew back, like a traveller at the sight of a
        serpent, and fell into a chair beside him. Edmond and Mercédès were
        clasped in each other&rsquo;s arms. The burning Marseilles sun, which shot
        into the room through the open door, covered them with a flood of light.
        At first they saw nothing around them. Their intense happiness isolated
        them from all the rest of the world, and they only spoke in broken words,
        which are the tokens of a joy so extreme that they seem rather the
        expression of sorrow. Suddenly Edmond saw the gloomy, pale, and
        threatening countenance of Fernand, as it was defined in the shadow. By a
        movement for which he could scarcely account to himself, the young Catalan
        placed his hand on the knife at his belt.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, your pardon,&rdquo; said Dantès, frowning in his turn; &ldquo;I
        did not perceive that there were three of us.&rdquo; Then, turning to
        Mercédès, he inquired, &ldquo;Who is this gentleman?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;One who will be your best friend, Dantès, for he is my friend, my
        cousin, my brother; it is Fernand&mdash;the man whom, after you, Edmond, I
        love the best in the world. Do you not remember him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; said Dantès, and without relinquishing Mercédès&rsquo; hand
        clasped in one of his own, he extended the other to the Catalan with a
        cordial air. But Fernand, instead of responding to this amiable gesture,
        remained mute and trembling. Edmond then cast his eyes scrutinizingly at
        the agitated and embarrassed Mercédès, and then again on the gloomy and
        menacing Fernand. This look told him all, and his anger waxed hot.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I did not know, when I came with such haste to you, that I was to
        meet an enemy here.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;An enemy!&rdquo; cried Mercédès, with an angry look at her cousin.
        &ldquo;An enemy in my house, do you say, Edmond! If I believed that, I
        would place my arm under yours and go with you to Marseilles, leaving the
        house to return to it no more.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Fernand&rsquo;s eye darted lightning. &ldquo;And should any misfortune
        occur to you, dear Edmond,&rdquo; she continued with the same calmness
        which proved to Fernand that the young girl had read the very innermost
        depths of his sinister thought, &ldquo;if misfortune should occur to you,
        I would ascend the highest point of the Cape de Morgiou and cast myself
        headlong from it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Fernand became deadly pale. &ldquo;But you are deceived, Edmond,&rdquo;
        she continued. &ldquo;You have no enemy here&mdash;there is no one but
        Fernand, my brother, who will grasp your hand as a devoted friend.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And at these words the young girl fixed her imperious look on the Catalan,
        who, as if fascinated by it, came slowly towards Edmond, and offered him
        his hand. His hatred, like a powerless though furious wave, was broken
        against the strong ascendancy which Mercédès exercised over him. Scarcely,
        however, had he touched Edmond&rsquo;s hand when he felt he had done all
        he could do, and rushed hastily out of the house.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he exclaimed, running furiously and tearing his hair&mdash;&ldquo;Oh,
        who will deliver me from this man? Wretched&mdash;wretched that I am!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Hallo, Catalan! Hallo, Fernand! where are you running to?&rdquo;
        exclaimed a voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The young man stopped suddenly, looked around him, and perceived
        Caderousse sitting at table with Danglars, under an arbor.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well&rdquo;, said Caderousse, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you come? Are
        you really in such a hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day
        with your friends?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Particularly when they have still a full bottle before them,&rdquo;
        added Danglars. Fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air, but did
        not say a word.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He seems besotted,&rdquo; said Danglars, pushing Caderousse with
        his knee. &ldquo;Are we mistaken, and is Dantès triumphant in spite of all
        we have believed?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, we must inquire into that,&rdquo; was Caderousse&rsquo;s
        reply; and turning towards the young man, said, &ldquo;Well, Catalan, can&rsquo;t
        you make up your mind?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Fernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow, and slowly
        entered the arbor, whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to
        his senses, and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted
        body.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Good-day,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;You called me, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
        And he fell, rather than sat down, on one of the seats which surrounded
        the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I called you because you were running like a madman, and I was
        afraid you would throw yourself into the sea,&rdquo; said Caderousse,
        laughing. &ldquo;Why, when a man has friends, they are not only to offer
        him a glass of wine, but, moreover, to prevent his swallowing three or
        four pints of water unnecessarily!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Fernand gave a groan, which resembled a sob, and dropped his head into his
        hands, his elbows leaning on the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, Fernand, I must say,&rdquo; said Caderousse, beginning the
        conversation, with that brutality of the common people in which curiosity
        destroys all diplomacy, &ldquo;you look uncommonly like a rejected lover;&rdquo;
        and he burst into a hoarse laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Danglars, &ldquo;a lad of his make was not born to
        be unhappy in love. You are laughing at him, Caderousse.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;only hark how he sighs! Come, come,
        Fernand,&rdquo; said Caderousse, &ldquo;hold up your head, and answer us.
        It&rsquo;s not polite not to reply to friends who ask news of your health.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My health is well enough,&rdquo; said Fernand, clenching his hands
        without raising his head.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, you see, Danglars,&rdquo; said Caderousse, winking at his
        friend, &ldquo;this is how it is; Fernand, whom you see here, is a good
        and brave Catalan, one of the best fishermen in Marseilles, and he is in
        love with a very fine girl, named Mercédès; but it appears, unfortunately,
        that the fine girl is in love with the mate of the <i>Pharaon</i>; and as
        the <i>Pharaon</i> arrived today&mdash;why, you understand!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; I do not understand,&rdquo; said Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Poor Fernand has been dismissed,&rdquo; continued Caderousse.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and what then?&rdquo; said Fernand, lifting up his head, and
        looking at Caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his
        anger; &ldquo;Mercédès is not accountable to any person, is she? Is she
        not free to love whomsoever she will?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, if you take it in that sense,&rdquo; said Caderousse, &ldquo;it
        is another thing. But I thought you were a Catalan, and they told me the
        Catalans were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival. It
        was even told me that Fernand, especially, was terrible in his vengeance.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Fernand smiled piteously. &ldquo;A lover is never terrible,&rdquo; he
        said.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; remarked Danglars, affecting to pity the young
        man from the bottom of his heart. &ldquo;Why, you see, he did not expect
        to see Dantès return so suddenly&mdash;he thought he was dead, perhaps; or
        perchance faithless! These things always come on us more severely when
        they come suddenly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, <i>ma foi</i>, under any circumstances!&rdquo; said Caderousse,
        who drank as he spoke, and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take
        effect,&mdash;&ldquo;under any circumstances Fernand is not the only
        person put out by the fortunate arrival of Dantès; is he, Danglars?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, you are right&mdash;and I should say that would bring him
        ill-luck.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, never mind,&rdquo; answered Caderousse, pouring out a glass
        of wine for Fernand, and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time,
        while Danglars had merely sipped his. &ldquo;Never mind&mdash;in the
        meantime he marries Mercédès&mdash;the lovely Mercédès&mdash;at least he
        returns to do that.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        During this time Danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man, on
        whose heart Caderousse&rsquo;s words fell like molten lead.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And when is the wedding to be?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, it is not yet fixed!&rdquo; murmured Fernand.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, but it will be,&rdquo; said Caderousse, &ldquo;as surely as
        Dantès will be captain of the <i>Pharaon</i>&mdash;eh, Danglars?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack, and turned to Caderousse,
        whose countenance he scrutinized, to try and detect whether the blow was
        premeditated; but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already
        rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, filling the glasses, &ldquo;let us drink to
        Captain Edmond Dantès, husband of the beautiful Catalane!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand, and swallowed
        the contents at a gulp. Fernand dashed his on the ground.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Eh, eh, eh!&rdquo; stammered Caderousse. &ldquo;What do I see down
        there by the wall, in the direction of the Catalans? Look, Fernand, your
        eyes are better than mine. I believe I see double. You know wine is a
        deceiver; but I should say it was two lovers walking side by side, and
        hand in hand. Heaven forgive me, they do not know that we can see them,
        and they are actually embracing!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars did not lose one pang that Fernand endured.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know them, Fernand?&rdquo; he said.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply, in a low voice. &ldquo;It is Edmond and
        Mercédès!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, see there, now!&rdquo; said Caderousse; &ldquo;and I did not
        recognize them! Hallo, Dantès! hello, lovely damsel! Come this way, and
        let us know when the wedding is to be, for Fernand here is so obstinate he
        will not tell us.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Hold your tongue, will you?&rdquo; said Danglars, pretending to
        restrain Caderousse, who, with the tenacity of drunkards, leaned out of
        the arbor. &ldquo;Try to stand upright, and let the lovers make love
        without interruption. See, look at Fernand, and follow his example; he is
        well-behaved!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0051m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        Fernand, probably excited beyond bearing, pricked by Danglars, as the bull
        is by the bandilleros, was about to rush out; for he had risen from his
        seat, and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his rival,
        when Mercédès, smiling and graceful, lifted up her lovely head, and looked
        at them with her clear and bright eyes. At this Fernand recollected her
        threat of dying if Edmond died, and dropped again heavily on his seat.
        Danglars looked at the two men, one after the other, the one brutalized by
        liquor, the other overwhelmed with love.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall get nothing from these fools,&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;and
        I am very much afraid of being here between a drunkard and a coward. Here&rsquo;s
        an envious fellow making himself boozy on wine when he ought to be nursing
        his wrath, and here is a fool who sees the woman he loves stolen from
        under his nose and takes on like a big baby. Yet this Catalan has eyes
        that glisten like those of the vengeful Spaniards, Sicilians, and
        Calabrians, and the other has fists big enough to crush an ox at one blow.
        Unquestionably, Edmond&rsquo;s star is in the ascendant, and he will marry
        the splendid girl&mdash;he will be captain, too, and laugh at us all,
        unless&rdquo;&mdash;a sinister smile passed over Danglars&rsquo; lips&mdash;&ldquo;unless
        I take a hand in the affair,&rdquo; he added.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Hallo!&rdquo; continued Caderousse, half-rising, and with his fist
        on the table, &ldquo;hallo, Edmond! do you not see your friends, or are
        you too proud to speak to them?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, my dear fellow!&rdquo; replied Dantès, &ldquo;I am not proud,
        but I am happy, and happiness blinds, I think, more than pride.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, very well, that&rsquo;s an explanation!&rdquo; said Caderousse.
        &ldquo;How do you do, Madame Dantès?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Mercédès courtesied gravely, and said&mdash;&ldquo;That is not my name,
        and in my country it bodes ill fortune, they say, to call a young girl by
        the name of her betrothed before he becomes her husband. So call me
        Mercédès, if you please.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We must excuse our worthy neighbor, Caderousse,&rdquo; said Dantès,
        &ldquo;he is so easily mistaken.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So, then, the wedding is to take place immediately, M. Dantès,&rdquo;
        said Danglars, bowing to the young couple.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As soon as possible, M. Danglars; today all preliminaries will be
        arranged at my father&rsquo;s, and tomorrow, or next day at latest, the
        wedding festival here at La Réserve. My friends will be there, I hope;
        that is to say, you are invited, M. Danglars, and you, Caderousse.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And Fernand,&rdquo; said Caderousse with a chuckle; &ldquo;Fernand,
        too, is invited!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My wife&rsquo;s brother is my brother,&rdquo; said Edmond; &ldquo;and
        we, Mercédès and I, should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Fernand opened his mouth to reply, but his voice died on his lips, and he
        could not utter a word.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Today the preliminaries, tomorrow or next day the ceremony! You are
        in a hurry, captain!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Danglars,&rdquo; said Edmond, smiling, &ldquo;I will say to you as
        Mercédès said just now to Caderousse, &lsquo;Do not give me a title which
        does not belong to me&rsquo;; that may bring me bad luck.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your pardon,&rdquo; replied Danglars, &ldquo;I merely said you
        seemed in a hurry, and we have lots of time; the <i>Pharaon</i> cannot be
        under weigh again in less than three months.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We are always in a hurry to be happy, M. Danglars; for when we have
        suffered a long time, we have great difficulty in believing in good
        fortune. But it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste; I
        must go to Paris.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, really?&mdash;to Paris! and will it be the first time you have
        ever been there, Dantès?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you business there?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not of my own; the last commission of poor Captain Leclere; you
        know to what I allude, Danglars&mdash;it is sacred. Besides, I shall only
        take the time to go and return.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, I understand,&rdquo; said Danglars, and then in a low
        tone, he added, &ldquo;To Paris, no doubt to deliver the letter which the
        grand marshal gave him. Ah, this letter gives me an idea&mdash;a capital
        idea! Ah; Dantès, my friend, you are not yet registered number one on
        board the good ship <i>Pharaon</i>;&rdquo; then turning towards Edmond,
        who was walking away, &ldquo;A pleasant journey,&rdquo; he cried.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Edmond with a friendly nod, and the two
        lovers continued on their way, as calm and joyous as if they were the very
        elect of heaven.
