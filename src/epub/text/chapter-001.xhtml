      <h2>Chapter 1. Marseilles&mdash;The Arrival</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n the 24th of
        February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde signalled the
        three-master, the <i>Pharaon</i> from Smyrna, Trieste, and Naples.
      </p>
      <p>
        As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Château d&rsquo;If,
        got on board the vessel between Cape Morgiou and Rion island.
      </p>
      <p>
        Immediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean were
        covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to
        come into port, especially when this ship, like the <i>Pharaon</i>, has
        been built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs to an
        owner of the city.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic
        shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled
        Pomègue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but
        so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the
        forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have happened
        on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any
        accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself, for she bore down
        with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the anchor a-cockbill,
        the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by the side of the
        pilot, who was steering the <i>Pharaon</i> towards the narrow entrance of
        the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and vigilant eye,
        watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each direction of the
        pilot.
      </p>
      <p>
        The vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much
        affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel
        in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled alongside
        the <i>Pharaon</i>, which he reached as she rounded into La Réserve basin.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his station
        by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship&rsquo;s bulwarks.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black
        eyes, and hair as dark as a raven&rsquo;s wing; and his whole appearance
        bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their
        cradle to contend with danger.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, is it you, Dantès?&rdquo; cried the man in the skiff. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s
        the matter? and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A great misfortune, M. Morrel,&rdquo; replied the young man, &ldquo;a
        great misfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave
        Captain Leclere.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And the cargo?&rdquo; inquired the owner, eagerly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that
        head. But poor Captain Leclere&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What happened to him?&rdquo; asked the owner, with an air of
        considerable resignation. &ldquo;What happened to the worthy captain?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He died.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Fell into the sea?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.&rdquo; Then
        turning to the crew, he said, &ldquo;Bear a hand there, to take in sail!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        All hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the
        crew, sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and
        outhaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail
        clewlines and buntlines. The young sailor gave a look to see that his
        orders were promptly and accurately obeyed, and then turned again to the
        owner.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And how did this misfortune occur?&rdquo; inquired the latter,
        resuming the interrupted conversation.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0023m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas, sir, in the most unexpected manner. After a long talk with
        the harbor-master, Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind.
        In twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days
        afterwards. We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his rest,
        sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six-pound shot at his head and his
        heels, off El Giglio island. We bring to his widow his sword and cross of
        honor. It was worth while, truly,&rdquo; added the young man with a
        melancholy smile, &ldquo;to make war against the English for ten years,
        and to die in his bed at last, like everybody else.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, you see, Edmond,&rdquo; replied the owner, who appeared more
        comforted at every moment, &ldquo;we are all mortal, and the old must make
        way for the young. If not, why, there would be no promotion; and since you
        assure me that the cargo&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is all safe and sound, M. Morrel, take my word for it; and I advise
        you not to take 25,000 francs for the profits of the voyage.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, as they were just passing the Round Tower, the young man shouted:
        &ldquo;Stand by there to lower the topsails and jib; brail up the spanker!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a
        man-of-war.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let go&mdash;and clue up!&rdquo; At this last command all the sails
        were lowered, and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now, if you will come on board, M. Morrel,&rdquo; said Dantès,
        observing the owner&rsquo;s impatience, &ldquo;here is your supercargo, M.
        Danglars, coming out of his cabin, who will furnish you with every
        particular. As for me, I must look after the anchoring, and dress the ship
        in mourning.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The owner did not wait for a second invitation. He seized a rope which
        Dantès flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit to a
        sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man, going to his
        task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came towards the owner.
        He was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, of unprepossessing
        countenance, obsequious to his superiors, insolent to his subordinates;
        and this, in addition to his position as responsible agent on board, which
        is always obnoxious to the sailors, made him as much disliked by the crew
        as Edmond Dantès was beloved by them.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, M. Morrel,&rdquo; said Danglars, &ldquo;you have heard of the
        misfortune that has befallen us?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes: poor Captain Leclere! He was a brave and an honest
        man.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And a first-rate seaman, one who had seen long and honorable
        service, as became a man charged with the interests of a house so
        important as that of Morrel &amp; Son,&rdquo; replied Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; replied the owner, glancing after Dantès, who was
        watching the anchoring of his vessel, &ldquo;it seems to me that a sailor
        needs not be so old as you say, Danglars, to understand his business, for
        our friend Edmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require
        instruction from anyone.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Danglars, darting at Edmond a look gleaming with
        hate. &ldquo;Yes, he is young, and youth is invariably self-confident.
        Scarcely was the captain&rsquo;s breath out of his body when he assumed
        the command without consulting anyone, and he caused us to lose a day and
        a half at the Island of Elba, instead of making for Marseilles direct.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0025m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As to taking command of the vessel,&rdquo; replied Morrel, &ldquo;that
        was his duty as captain&rsquo;s mate; as to losing a day and a half off
        the Island of Elba, he was wrong, unless the vessel needed repairs.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The vessel was in as good condition as I am, and as, I hope you
        are, M. Morrel, and this day and a half was lost from pure whim, for the
        pleasure of going ashore, and nothing else.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Dantès,&rdquo; said the shipowner, turning towards the young man,
        &ldquo;come this way!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In a moment, sir,&rdquo; answered Dantès, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m with
        you.&rdquo; Then calling to the crew, he said, &ldquo;Let go!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The anchor was instantly dropped, and the chain ran rattling through the
        port-hole. Dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of the
        pilot, until this man&oelig;uvre was completed, and then he added, &ldquo;Half-mast
        the colors, and square the yards!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said Danglars, &ldquo;he fancies himself captain
        already, upon my word.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And so, in fact, he is,&rdquo; said the owner.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Except your signature and your partner&rsquo;s, M. Morrel.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And why should he not have this?&rdquo; asked the owner; &ldquo;he
        is young, it is true, but he seems to me a thorough seaman, and of full
        experience.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        A cloud passed over Danglars&rsquo; brow.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your pardon, M. Morrel,&rdquo; said Dantès, approaching, &ldquo;the
        vessel now rides at anchor, and I am at your service. You hailed me, I think?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars retreated a step or two. &ldquo;I wished to inquire why you
        stopped at the Island of Elba?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not know, sir; it was to fulfil the last instructions of
        Captain Leclere, who, when dying, gave me a packet for Marshal Bertrand.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then did you see him, Edmond?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The marshal.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel looked around him, and then, drawing Dantès on one side, he said
        suddenly&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And how is the emperor?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very well, as far as I could judge from the sight of him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You saw the emperor, then?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He entered the marshal&rsquo;s apartment while I was there.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you spoke to him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, it was he who spoke to me, sir,&rdquo; said Dantès, with a
        smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what did he say to you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Asked me questions about the vessel, the time she left Marseilles,
        the course she had taken, and what was her cargo. I believe, if she had
        not been laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her. But I
        told him I was only mate, and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel
        &amp; Son. &lsquo;Ah, yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I know them. The Morrels
        have been shipowners from father to son; and there was a Morrel who served
        in the same regiment with me when I was in garrison at Valence.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Pardieu!</i> and that is true!&rdquo; cried the owner, greatly
        delighted. &ldquo;And that was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who was
        afterwards a captain. Dantès, you must tell my uncle that the emperor
        remembered him, and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldier&rsquo;s
        eyes. Come, come,&rdquo; continued he, patting Edmond&rsquo;s shoulder
        kindly, &ldquo;you did very right, Dantès, to follow Captain Leclere&rsquo;s
        instructions, and touch at Elba, although if it were known that you had
        conveyed a packet to the marshal, and had conversed with the emperor, it
        might bring you into trouble.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0027m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How could that bring me into trouble, sir?&rdquo; asked Dantès;
        &ldquo;for I did not even know of what I was the bearer; and the emperor
        merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer. But, pardon me,
        here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside.&rdquo;
        And the young man went to the gangway. As he departed, Danglars
        approached, and said,&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his
        landing at Porto-Ferrajo?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, most satisfactory, my dear Danglars.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, so much the better,&rdquo; said the supercargo; &ldquo;for it
        is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Dantès has done his,&rdquo; replied the owner, &ldquo;and that is
        not saying much. It was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this delay.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Talking of Captain Leclere, has not Dantès given you a letter from
        him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To me?&mdash;no&mdash;was there one?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I believe that, besides the packet, Captain Leclere confided a
        letter to his care.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of what packet are you speaking, Danglars?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, that which Dantès left at Porto-Ferrajo.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How do you know he had a packet to leave at Porto-Ferrajo?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars turned very red.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I was passing close to the door of the captain&rsquo;s cabin, which
        was half open, and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dantès.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He did not speak to me of it,&rdquo; replied the shipowner; &ldquo;but
        if there be any letter he will give it to me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars reflected for a moment. &ldquo;Then, M. Morrel, I beg of you,&rdquo;
        said he, &ldquo;not to say a word to Dantès on the subject. I may have
        been mistaken.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment the young man returned; Danglars withdrew.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, my dear Dantès, are you now free?&rdquo; inquired the owner.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have not been long detained.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No. I gave the custom-house officers a copy of our bill of lading;
        and as to the other papers, they sent a man off with the pilot, to whom I
        gave them.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you have nothing more to do here?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No&mdash;everything is all right now.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you can come and dine with me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I really must ask you to excuse me, M. Morrel. My first visit is
        due to my father, though I am not the less grateful for the honor you have
        done me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0029m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Right, Dantès, quite right. I always knew you were a good son.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And,&rdquo; inquired Dantès, with some hesitation, &ldquo;do you
        know how my father is?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I believe, my dear Edmond, though I have not seen him lately.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That proves, at least, that he has wanted for nothing during your
        absence.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Dantès smiled. &ldquo;My father is proud, sir, and if he had not a meal
        left, I doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone, except from
        Heaven.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, after this first visit has been made we shall count on
        you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I must again excuse myself, M. Morrel, for after this first visit
        has been paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;True, Dantès, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who
        expects you no less impatiently than your father&mdash;the lovely
        Mercédès.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Dantès blushed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, ha,&rdquo; said the shipowner, &ldquo;I am not in the least
        surprised, for she has been to me three times, inquiring if there were any
        news of the <i>Pharaon</i>. <i>Peste!</i> Edmond, you have a very
        handsome mistress!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;She is not my mistress,&rdquo; replied the young sailor, gravely;
        &ldquo;she is my betrothed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sometimes one and the same thing,&rdquo; said Morrel, with a smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not with us, sir,&rdquo; replied Dantès.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, well, my dear Edmond,&rdquo; continued the owner, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
        let me detain you. You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to
        allow you all the time you require for your own. Do you want any money?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, sir; I have all my pay to take&mdash;nearly three months&rsquo;
        wages.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are a careful fellow, Edmond.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Say I have a poor father, sir.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know how good a son you are, so now hasten away to see
        your father. I have a son too, and I should be very wroth with those who
        detained him from me after a three months&rsquo; voyage.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then I have your leave, sir?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, if you have nothing more to say to me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Captain Leclere did not, before he died, give you a letter for me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He was unable to write, sir. But that reminds me that I must ask
        your leave of absence for some days.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To get married?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, first, and then to go to Paris.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very good; have what time you require, Dantès. It will take quite
        six weeks to unload the cargo, and we cannot get you ready for sea until
        three months after that; only be back again in three months, for the <i>Pharaon</i>,&rdquo;
        added the owner, patting the young sailor on the back, &ldquo;cannot sail
        without her captain.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Without her captain!&rdquo; cried Dantès, his eyes sparkling with
        animation; &ldquo;pray mind what you say, for you are touching on the most
        secret wishes of my heart. Is it really your intention to make me captain
        of the <i>Pharaon</i>?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If I were sole owner we&rsquo;d shake hands on it now, my dear
        Dantès, and call it settled; but I have a partner, and you know the
        Italian proverb&mdash;<i>Chi ha compagno ha padrone</i>&mdash;&lsquo;He
        who has a partner has a master.&rsquo; But the thing is at least half
        done, as you have one out of two votes. Rely on me to procure you the
        other; I will do my best.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, M. Morrel,&rdquo; exclaimed the young seaman, with tears in his
        eyes, and grasping the owner&rsquo;s hand, &ldquo;M. Morrel, I thank you
        in the name of my father and of Mercédès.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, Edmond. There&rsquo;s a providence that
        watches over the deserving. Go to your father; go and see Mercédès, and
        afterwards come to me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall I row you ashore?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, thank you; I shall remain and look over the accounts with
        Danglars. Have you been satisfied with him this voyage?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is according to the sense you attach to the question, sir. Do
        you mean is he a good comrade? No, for I think he never liked me since the
        day when I was silly enough, after a little quarrel we had, to propose to
        him to stop for ten minutes at the island of Monte Cristo to settle the
        dispute&mdash;a proposition which I was wrong to suggest, and he quite
        right to refuse. If you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the
        question, I believe there is nothing to say against him, and that you will
        be content with the way in which he has performed his duty.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But tell me, Dantès, if you had command of the <i>Pharaon</i>
        should you be glad to see Danglars remain?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Captain or mate, M. Morrel, I shall always have the greatest
        respect for those who possess the owners&rsquo; confidence.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right, Dantès! I see you are a
        thoroughly good fellow, and will detain you no longer. Go, for I see how
        impatient you are.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then I have leave?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Go, I tell you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;May I have the use of your skiff?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then, for the present, M. Morrel, farewell, and a thousand thanks!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I hope soon to see you again, my dear Edmond. Good luck to you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The young sailor jumped into the skiff, and sat down in the stern sheets,
        with the order that he be put ashore at La Canebière. The two oarsmen bent
        to their work, and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in
        the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which
        leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the
        Quai d&rsquo;Orléans.
      </p>
      <p>
        The shipowner, smiling, followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring
        out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng, which from five
        o&rsquo;clock in the morning until nine o&rsquo;clock at night, swarms in
        the famous street of La Canebière,&mdash;a street of which the modern
        Phocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world, and
        with that accent which gives so much character to what is said, &ldquo;If
        Paris had La Canebière, Paris would be a second Marseilles.&rdquo; On
        turning round the owner saw Danglars behind him, apparently awaiting
        orders, but in reality also watching the young sailor,&mdash;but there was
        a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the
        movements of Edmond Dantès.
