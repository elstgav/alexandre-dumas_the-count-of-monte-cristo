      <h2>Chapter 33. Roman Bandits</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he next morning
        Franz woke first, and instantly rang the bell. The sound had not yet died
        away when Signor Pastrini himself entered.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, excellency,&rdquo; said the landlord triumphantly, and
        without waiting for Franz to question him, &ldquo;I feared yesterday, when
        I would not promise you anything, that you were too late&mdash;there is
        not a single carriage to be had&mdash;that is, for the three last days&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Franz, &ldquo;for the very three days it is
        most needed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; said Albert, entering; &ldquo;no
        carriage to be had?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; returned Franz, &ldquo;you have guessed it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, your Eternal City is a nice sort of place.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is to say, excellency,&rdquo; replied Pastrini, who was
        desirous of keeping up the dignity of the capital of the Christian world
        in the eyes of his guest, &ldquo;that there are no carriages to be had
        from Sunday to Tuesday evening, but from now till Sunday you can have
        fifty if you please.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, that is something,&rdquo; said Albert; &ldquo;today is
        Thursday, and who knows what may arrive between this and Sunday?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ten or twelve thousand travellers will arrive,&rdquo; replied
        Franz, &ldquo;which will make it still more difficult.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Morcerf, &ldquo;let us enjoy the present
        without gloomy forebodings for the future.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At least we can have a window?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In the Corso.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, a window!&rdquo; exclaimed Signor Pastrini,&mdash;&ldquo;utterly
        impossible; there was only one left on the fifth floor of the Doria
        Palace, and that has been let to a Russian prince for twenty sequins a
        day.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The two young men looked at each other with an air of stupefaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Franz to Albert, &ldquo;do you know what is the
        best thing we can do? It is to pass the Carnival at Venice; there we are
        sure of obtaining gondolas if we cannot have carriages.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, the devil, no,&rdquo; cried Albert; &ldquo;I came to Rome to
        see the Carnival, and I will, though I see it on stilts.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bravo! an excellent idea. We will disguise ourselves as monster
        pulchinellos or shepherds of the Landes, and we shall have complete
        success.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do your excellencies still wish for a carriage from now to Sunday
        morning?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Parbleu!</i>&rdquo; said Albert, &ldquo;do you think we are
        going to run about on foot in the streets of Rome, like lawyers&rsquo;
        clerks?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I hasten to comply with your excellencies&rsquo; wishes; only, I
        tell you beforehand, the carriage will cost you six piastres a day.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And, as I am not a millionaire, like the gentleman in the next
        apartments,&rdquo; said Franz, &ldquo;I warn you, that as I have been four
        times before at Rome, I know the prices of all the carriages; we will give
        you twelve piastres for today, tomorrow, and the day after, and then you
        will make a good profit.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But, excellency&rdquo;&mdash;said Pastrini, still striving to gain
        his point.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now go,&rdquo; returned Franz, &ldquo;or I shall go myself and
        bargain with your <i>affettatore</i>, who is mine also; he is an old
        friend of mine, who has plundered me pretty well already, and, in the hope
        of making more out of me, he will take a less price than the one I offer
        you; you will lose the preference, and that will be your fault.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do not give yourselves the trouble, excellency,&rdquo; returned
        Signor Pastrini, with the smile peculiar to the Italian speculator when he
        confesses defeat; &ldquo;I will do all I can, and I hope you will be
        satisfied.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And now we understand each other.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;When do you wish the carriage to be here?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In an hour.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In an hour it will be at the door.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        An hour after the vehicle was at the door; it was a hack conveyance which
        was elevated to the rank of a private carriage in honor of the occasion,
        but, in spite of its humble exterior, the young men would have thought
        themselves happy to have secured it for the last three days of the Carnival.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Excellency,&rdquo; cried the <i>cicerone</i>, seeing Franz approach the
        window, &ldquo;shall I bring the carriage nearer to the palace?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Accustomed as Franz was to the Italian phraseology, his first impulse was
        to look round him, but these words were addressed to him. Franz was the
        &ldquo;excellency,&rdquo; the vehicle was the &ldquo;carriage,&rdquo; and
        the Hôtel de Londres was the &ldquo;palace.&rdquo; The genius for
        laudation characteristic of the race was in that phrase.
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz and Albert descended, the carriage approached the palace; their
        excellencies stretched their legs along the seats; the <i>cicerone</i>
        sprang into the seat behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where do your excellencies wish to go?&rdquo; asked he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To Saint Peter&rsquo;s first, and then to the Colosseum,&rdquo;
        returned Albert. But Albert did not know that it takes a day to see Saint
        Peter&rsquo;s, and a month to study it. The day was passed at Saint Peter&rsquo;s
        alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly the daylight began to fade away; Franz took out his watch&mdash;it
        was half-past four. They returned to the hotel; at the door Franz ordered
        the coachman to be ready at eight. He wished to show Albert the Colosseum
        by moonlight, as he had shown him Saint Peter&rsquo;s by daylight. When we
        show a friend a city one has already visited, we feel the same pride as
        when we point out a woman whose lover we have been.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo, skirt the outer wall,
        and re-enter by the Porta San Giovanni; thus they would behold the
        Colosseum without finding their impressions dulled by first looking on the
        Capitol, the Forum, the Arch of Septimus Severus, the Temple of Antoninus
        and Faustina, and the Via Sacra.
      </p>
      <p>
        They sat down to dinner. Signor Pastrini had promised them a banquet; he
        gave them a tolerable repast. At the end of the dinner he entered in
        person. Franz thought that he came to hear his dinner praised, and began
        accordingly, but at the first words he was interrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Excellency,&rdquo; said Pastrini, &ldquo;I am delighted to have your
        approbation, but it was not for that I came.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you come to tell us you have procured a carriage?&rdquo; asked
        Albert, lighting his cigar.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; and your excellencies will do well not to think of that any
        longer; at Rome things can or cannot be done; when you are told anything
        cannot be done, there is an end of it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is much more convenient at Paris,&mdash;when anything cannot be
        done, you pay double, and it is done directly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is what all the French say,&rdquo; returned Signor Pastrini,
        somewhat piqued; &ldquo;for that reason, I do not understand why they
        travel.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Albert, emitting a volume of smoke and balancing
        his chair on its hind legs, &ldquo;only madmen, or blockheads like us,
        ever do travel. Men in their senses do not quit their hotel in the Rue du
        Helder, their walk on the Boulevard de Gand, and the Café de Paris.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        It is of course understood that Albert resided in the aforesaid street,
        appeared every day on the fashionable walk, and dined frequently at the
        only restaurant where you can really dine, that is, if you are on good
        terms with its waiters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Signor Pastrini remained silent a short time; it was evident that he was
        musing over this answer, which did not seem very clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Franz, in his turn interrupting his host&rsquo;s
        meditations, &ldquo;you had some motive for coming here, may I beg to know
        what it was?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20099m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, yes; you have ordered your carriage at eight o&rsquo;clock
        precisely?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You intend visiting <i>Il Colosseo</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You mean the Colosseum?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is the same thing. You have told your coachman to leave the city
        by the Porta del Popolo, to drive round the walls, and re-enter by the
        Porta San Giovanni?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;These are my words exactly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, this route is impossible.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very dangerous, to say the least.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Dangerous!&mdash;and why?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On account of the famous Luigi Vampa.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Pray, who may this famous Luigi Vampa be?&rdquo; inquired Albert;
        &ldquo;he may be very famous at Rome, but I can assure you he is quite
        unknown at Paris.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What! do you not know him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have not that honor.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have never heard his name?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, he is a bandit, compared to whom the Decesaris and the
        Gasparones were mere children.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now then, Albert,&rdquo; cried Franz, &ldquo;here is a bandit for
        you at last.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I forewarn you, Signor Pastrini, that I shall not believe one word
        of what you are going to tell us; having told you this, begin. &lsquo;Once
        upon a time&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; Well, go on.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Signor Pastrini turned toward Franz, who seemed to him the more reasonable
        of the two; we must do him justice,&mdash;he had had a great many
        Frenchmen in his house, but had never been able to comprehend them.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Excellency,&rdquo; said he gravely, addressing Franz, &ldquo;if you
        look upon me as a liar, it is useless for me to say anything; it was for
        your interest I&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Albert does not say you are a liar, Signor Pastrini,&rdquo; said
        Franz, &ldquo;but that he will not believe what you are going to tell us,&mdash;but
        I will believe all you say; so proceed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But if your excellency doubt my veracity&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Signor Pastrini,&rdquo; returned Franz, &ldquo;you are more
        susceptible than Cassandra, who was a prophetess, and yet no one believed
        her; while you, at least, are sure of the credence of half your audience.
        Come, sit down, and tell us all about this Signor Vampa.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I had told your excellency he is the most famous bandit we have had
        since the days of Mastrilla.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what has this bandit to do with the order I have given the
        coachman to leave the city by the Porta del Popolo, and to re-enter by the
        Porta San Giovanni?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20101m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This,&rdquo; replied Signor Pastrini, &ldquo;that you will go out
        by one, but I very much doubt your returning by the other.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because, after nightfall, you are not safe fifty yards from the
        gates.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On your honor, is that true?&rdquo; cried Albert.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Count,&rdquo; returned Signor Pastrini, hurt at Albert&rsquo;s
        repeated doubts of the truth of his assertions, &ldquo;I do not say this
        to you, but to your companion, who knows Rome, and knows, too, that these
        things are not to be laughed at.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear fellow,&rdquo; said Albert, turning to Franz, &ldquo;here
        is an admirable adventure; we will fill our carriage with pistols,
        blunderbusses, and double-barrelled guns. Luigi Vampa comes to take us,
        and we take him&mdash;we bring him back to Rome, and present him to his
        holiness the Pope, who asks how he can repay so great a service; then we
        merely ask for a carriage and a pair of horses, and we see the Carnival in
        the carriage, and doubtless the Roman people will crown us at the Capitol,
        and proclaim us, like Curtius and Horatius Cocles, the preservers of their
        country.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst Albert proposed this scheme, Signor Pastrini&rsquo;s face assumed
        an expression impossible to describe.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And pray,&rdquo; asked Franz, &ldquo;where are these pistols,
        blunderbusses, and other deadly weapons with which you intend filling the
        carriage?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not out of my armory, for at Terracina I was plundered even of my
        hunting-knife. And you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I shared the same fate at Aquapendente.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know, Signor Pastrini,&rdquo; said Albert, lighting a second
        cigar at the first, &ldquo;that this practice is very convenient for
        bandits, and that it seems to be due to an arrangement of their own.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Doubtless Signor Pastrini found this pleasantry compromising, for he only
        answered half the question, and then he spoke to Franz, as the only one
        likely to listen with attention. &ldquo;Your excellency knows that it is
        not customary to defend yourself when attacked by bandits.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried Albert, whose courage revolted at the idea of
        being plundered tamely, &ldquo;not make any resistance!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, for it would be useless. What could you do against a dozen
        bandits who spring out of some pit, ruin, or aqueduct, and level their
        pieces at you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Eh, <i>parbleu!</i>&mdash;they should kill me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The innkeeper turned to Franz with an air that seemed to say, &ldquo;Your
        friend is decidedly mad.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear Albert,&rdquo; returned Franz, &ldquo;your answer is
        sublime, and worthy the &lsquo;<i>Let him die</i>,&rsquo; of Corneille,
        only, when Horace made that answer, the safety of Rome was concerned; but,
        as for us, it is only to gratify a whim, and it would be ridiculous to
        risk our lives for so foolish a motive.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Albert poured himself out a glass of <i>lacryma Christi</i>, which he sipped
        at intervals, muttering some unintelligible words.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, Signor Pastrini,&rdquo; said Franz, &ldquo;now that my
        companion is quieted, and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are,
        tell me who is this Luigi Vampa. Is he a shepherd or a nobleman?&mdash;young
        or old?&mdash;tall or short? Describe him, in order that, if we meet him
        by chance, like Jean Sbogar or Lara, we may recognize him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all
        these points, for I knew him when he was a child, and one day that I fell
        into his hands, going from Ferentino to Alatri, he, fortunately for me,
        recollected me, and set me free, not only without ransom, but made me a
        present of a very splendid watch, and related his history to me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us see the watch,&rdquo; said Albert.
      </p>
      <p>
        Signor Pastrini drew from his fob a magnificent Bréguet, bearing the name
        of its maker, of Parisian manufacture, and a count&rsquo;s coronet.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Peste!</i>&rdquo; returned Albert, &ldquo;I compliment you on
        it; I have its fellow&rdquo;&mdash;he took his watch from his waistcoat
        pocket&mdash;&ldquo;and it cost me 3,000 francs.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us hear the history,&rdquo; said Franz, motioning Signor
        Pastrini to seat himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your excellencies permit it?&rdquo; asked the host.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Pardieu!</i>&rdquo; cried Albert, &ldquo;you are not a preacher,
        to remain standing!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The host sat down, after having made each of them a respectful bow, which
        meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know concerning
        Luigi Vampa.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You tell me,&rdquo; said Franz, at the moment Signor
        Pastrini was about to open his mouth, &ldquo;that you knew Luigi Vampa
        when he was a child&mdash;he is still a young man, then?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A young man? he is only two-and-twenty;&mdash;he will gain himself
        a reputation.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you think of that, Albert?&mdash;at two-and-twenty to be
        thus famous?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, and at his age, Alexander, Cæsar, and Napoleon, who have all
        made some noise in the world, were quite behind him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So,&rdquo; continued Franz, &ldquo;the hero of this history is only
        two-and-twenty?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Scarcely so much.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is he tall or short?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of the middle height&mdash;about the same stature as his
        excellency,&rdquo; returned the host, pointing to Albert.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thanks for the comparison,&rdquo; said Albert, with a bow.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Go on, Signor Pastrini,&rdquo; continued Franz, smiling at his
        friend&rsquo;s susceptibility. &ldquo;To what class of society does he
        belong?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He was a shepherd-boy attached to the farm of the Count of
        San-Felice, situated between Palestrina and the Lake of Gabri; he was born
        at Pampinara, and entered the count&rsquo;s service when he was five years
        old; his father was also a shepherd, who owned a small flock, and lived by
        the wool and the milk, which he sold at Rome. When quite a child, the
        little Vampa displayed a most extraordinary precocity. One day, when he
        was seven years old, he came to the curate of Palestrina, and asked to be
        taught to read; it was somewhat difficult, for he could not quit his
        flock; but the good curate went every day to say mass at a little hamlet
        too poor to pay a priest and which, having no other name, was called
        Borgo; he told Luigi that he might meet him on his return, and that then
        he would give him a lesson, warning him that it would be short, and that
        he must profit as much as possible by it. The child accepted joyfully.
        Every day Luigi led his flock to graze on the road that leads from
        Palestrina to Borgo; every day, at nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning, the
        priest and the boy sat down on a bank by the wayside, and the little
        shepherd took his lesson out of the priest&rsquo;s breviary. At the end of
        three months he had learned to read. This was not enough&mdash;he must now
        learn to write. The priest had a writing teacher at Rome make three
        alphabets&mdash;one large, one middling, and one small; and pointed out to
        him that by the help of a sharp instrument he could trace the letters on a
        slate, and thus learn to write. The same evening, when the flock was safe
        at the farm, the little Luigi hastened to the smith at Palestrina, took a
        large nail, heated and sharpened it, and formed a sort of stylus. The next
        morning he gathered an armful of pieces of slate and began. At the end of
        three months he had learned to write. The curate, astonished at his
        quickness and intelligence, made him a present of pens, paper, and a
        penknife. This demanded new effort, but nothing compared to the first; at
        the end of a week he wrote as well with this pen as with the stylus. The
        curate related the incident to the Count of San-Felice, who sent for the
        little shepherd, made him read and write before him, ordered his attendant
        to let him eat with the domestics, and to give him two piastres a month.
        With this, Luigi purchased books and pencils. He applied his imitative
        powers to everything, and, like Giotto, when young, he drew on his slate
        sheep, houses, and trees. Then, with his knife, he began to carve all
        sorts of objects in wood; it was thus that Pinelli, the famous sculptor,
        had commenced.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20105m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A girl of six or seven&mdash;that is, a little younger than Vampa&mdash;tended
        sheep on a farm near Palestrina; she was an orphan, born at Valmontone and
        was named Teresa. The two children met, sat down near each other, let
        their flocks mingle together, played, laughed, and conversed together; in
        the evening they separated the Count of San-Felice&rsquo;s flock from
        those of Baron Cervetri, and the children returned to their respective
        farms, promising to meet the next morning. The next day they kept their
        word, and thus they grew up together. Vampa was twelve, and Teresa eleven.
        And yet their natural disposition revealed itself. Beside his taste for
        the fine arts, which Luigi had carried as far as he could in his solitude,
        he was given to alternating fits of sadness and enthusiasm, was often
        angry and capricious, and always sarcastic. None of the lads of Pampinara,
        Palestrina, or Valmontone had been able to gain any influence over him or
        even to become his companion. His disposition (always inclined to exact
        concessions rather than to make them) kept him aloof from all friendships.
        Teresa alone ruled by a look, a word, a gesture, this impetuous character,
        which yielded beneath the hand of a woman, and which beneath the hand of a
        man might have broken, but could never have been bended. Teresa was lively
        and gay, but coquettish to excess. The two piastres that Luigi received
        every month from the Count of San-Felice&rsquo;s steward, and the price of
        all the little carvings in wood he sold at Rome, were expended in ear-rings,
        necklaces, and gold hairpins. So that, thanks to her friend&rsquo;s generosity,
        Teresa was the most beautiful and the best-attired peasant near Rome.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The two children grew up together, passing all their time with
        each other, and giving themselves up to the wild ideas of their different
        characters. Thus, in all their dreams, their wishes, and their
        conversations, Vampa saw himself the captain of a vessel, general of an
        army, or governor of a province. Teresa saw herself rich, superbly
        attired, and attended by a train of liveried domestics. Then, when they
        had thus passed the day in building castles in the air, they separated
        their flocks, and descended from the elevation of their dreams to the
        reality of their humble position.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;One day the young shepherd told the count&rsquo;s steward that he
        had seen a wolf come out of the Sabine mountains, and prowl around his
        flock. The steward gave him a gun; this was what Vampa longed for. This
        gun had an excellent barrel, made at Brescia, and carrying a ball with the
        precision of an English rifle; but one day the count broke the stock, and
        had then cast the gun aside. This, however, was nothing to a sculptor like
        Vampa; he examined the broken stock, calculated what change it would
        require to adapt the gun to his shoulder, and made a fresh stock, so
        beautifully carved that it would have fetched fifteen or twenty piastres,
        had he chosen to sell it. But nothing could be farther from his thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;For a long time a gun had been the young man&rsquo;s greatest
        ambition. In every country where independence has taken the place of
        liberty, the first desire of a manly heart is to possess a weapon, which
        at once renders him capable of defence or attack, and, by rendering its
        owner terrible, often makes him feared. From this moment Vampa devoted all
        his leisure time to perfecting himself in the use of his precious weapon;
        he purchased powder and ball, and everything served him for a mark&mdash;the
        trunk of some old and moss-grown olive-tree, that grew on the Sabine
        mountains; the fox, as he quitted his earth on some marauding excursion;
        the eagle that soared above their heads: and thus he soon became so
        expert, that Teresa overcame the terror she at first felt at the report,
        and amused herself by watching him direct the ball wherever he pleased,
        with as much accuracy as if he placed it by hand.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20107m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;One evening a wolf emerged from a pine-wood near which they were
        usually stationed, but the wolf had scarcely advanced ten yards ere he was
        dead. Proud of this exploit, Vampa took the dead animal on his shoulders,
        and carried him to the farm. These exploits had gained Luigi considerable
        reputation. The man of superior abilities always finds admirers, go where
        he will. He was spoken of as the most adroit, the strongest, and the most
        courageous <i>contadino</i> for ten leagues around; and although Teresa
        was universally allowed to be the most beautiful girl of the Sabines, no
        one had ever spoken to her of love, because it was known that she was
        beloved by Vampa. And yet the two young people had never declared their
        affection; they had grown together like two trees whose roots are mingled,
        whose branches intertwined, and whose intermingled perfume rises to the
        heavens. Only their wish to see each other had become a necessity, and
        they would have preferred death to a day&rsquo;s separation.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Teresa was sixteen, and Vampa seventeen. About this time, a band of
        brigands that had established itself in the Lepini mountains began to be
        much spoken of. The brigands have never been really extirpated from the
        neighborhood of Rome. Sometimes a chief is wanted, but when a chief
        presents himself he rarely has to wait long for a band of followers.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The celebrated Cucumetto, pursued in the Abruzzo, driven out of the
        kingdom of Naples, where he had carried on a regular war, had crossed the
        Garigliano, like Manfred, and had taken refuge on the banks of the Amasine
        between Sonnino and Juperno. He strove to collect a band of followers, and
        followed the footsteps of Decesaris and Gasparone, whom he hoped to
        surpass. Many young men of Palestrina, Frascati, and Pampinara had
        disappeared. Their disappearance at first caused much disquietude; but it
        was soon known that they had joined Cucumetto. After some time Cucumetto
        became the object of universal attention; the most extraordinary traits of
        ferocious daring and brutality were related of him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;One day he carried off a young girl, the daughter of a surveyor of
        Frosinone. The bandit&rsquo;s laws are positive; a young girl belongs
        first to him who carries her off, then the rest draw lots for her, and she
        is abandoned to their brutality until death relieves her sufferings. When
        their parents are sufficiently rich to pay a ransom, a messenger is sent
        to negotiate; the prisoner is hostage for the security of the messenger;
        should the ransom be refused, the prisoner is irrevocably lost. The young
        girl&rsquo;s lover was in Cucumetto&rsquo;s troop; his name was Carlini.
        When she recognized her lover, the poor girl extended her arms to him, and
        believed herself safe; but Carlini felt his heart sink, for he but too
        well knew the fate that awaited her. However, as he was a favorite with
        Cucumetto, as he had for three years faithfully served him, and as he had
        saved his life by shooting a dragoon who was about to cut him down, he
        hoped the chief would have pity on him. He took Cucumetto one side, while
        the young girl, seated at the foot of a huge pine that stood in the centre
        of the forest, made a veil of her picturesque head-dress to hide her face
        from the lascivious gaze of the bandits. There he told the chief all&mdash;his
        affection for the prisoner, their promises of mutual fidelity, and how
        every night, since he had been near, they had met in some neighboring
        ruins.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20109m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It so happened that night that Cucumetto had sent Carlini to a
        village, so that he had been unable to go to the place of meeting.
        Cucumetto had been there, however, by accident, as he said, and had
        carried the maiden off. Carlini besought his chief to make an exception in
        Rita&rsquo;s favor, as her father was rich, and could pay a large ransom.
        Cucumetto seemed to yield to his friend&rsquo;s entreaties, and bade him
        find a shepherd to send to Rita&rsquo;s father at Frosinone.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Carlini flew joyfully to Rita, telling her she was saved, and
        bidding her write to her father, to inform him what had occurred, and that
        her ransom was fixed at three hundred piastres. Twelve hours&rsquo; delay
        was all that was granted&mdash;that is, until nine the next morning. The
        instant the letter was written, Carlini seized it, and hastened to the
        plain to find a messenger. He found a young shepherd watching his flock.
        The natural messengers of the bandits are the shepherds who live between
        the city and the mountains, between civilized and savage life. The boy
        undertook the commission, promising to be in Frosinone in less than an
        hour. Carlini returned, anxious to see his mistress, and announce the
        joyful intelligence. He found the troop in the glade, supping off the
        provisions exacted as contributions from the peasants; but his eye vainly
        sought Rita and Cucumetto among them.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He inquired where they were, and was answered by a burst of
        laughter. A cold perspiration burst from every pore, and his hair stood on
        end. He repeated his question. One of the bandits rose, and offered him a
        glass filled with Orvietto, saying, &lsquo;To the health of the brave
        Cucumetto and the fair Rita.&rsquo; At this moment Carlini heard a woman&rsquo;s
        cry; he divined the truth, seized the glass, broke it across the face of
        him who presented it, and rushed towards the spot whence the cry came.
        After a hundred yards he turned the corner of the thicket; he found Rita
        senseless in the arms of Cucumetto. At the sight of Carlini, Cucumetto
        rose, a pistol in each hand. The two brigands looked at each other for a
        moment&mdash;the one with a smile of lasciviousness on his lips, the other
        with the pallor of death on his brow. A terrible battle between the two
        men seemed imminent; but by degrees Carlini&rsquo;s features relaxed, his
        hand, which had grasped one of the pistols in his belt, fell to his side.
        Rita lay between them. The moon lighted the group.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Cucumetto, &lsquo;have you executed your
        commission?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, captain,&rsquo; returned Carlini. &lsquo;At nine o&rsquo;clock
        tomorrow Rita&rsquo;s father will be here with the money.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;It is well; in the meantime, we will have a merry night; this young
        girl is charming, and does credit to your taste. Now, as I am not egotistical, we
        will return to our comrades and draw lots for her.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;You have determined, then, to abandon her to the common
        law?&rsquo; said Carlini.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Why should an exception be made in her favor?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;I thought that my entreaties&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;What right have you, any more than the rest, to ask for an
        exception?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;It is true.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;But never mind,&rsquo; continued Cucumetto, laughing,
        &lsquo;sooner or later your turn will come.&rsquo; Carlini&rsquo;s teeth
        clenched convulsively.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Now, then,&rsquo; said Cucumetto, advancing towards the
        other bandits, &lsquo;are you coming?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;I follow you.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20111m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Cucumetto departed, without losing sight of Carlini, for,
        doubtless, he feared lest he should strike him unawares; but nothing
        betrayed a hostile design on Carlini&rsquo;s part. He was standing, his
        arms folded, near Rita, who was still insensible. Cucumetto fancied for a
        moment the young man was about to take her in his arms and fly; but this
        mattered little to him now Rita had been his; and as for the money, three
        hundred piastres distributed among the band was so small a sum that he
        cared little about it. He continued to follow the path to the glade; but,
        to his great surprise, Carlini arrived almost as soon as himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Let us draw lots! let us draw lots!&rsquo; cried all the brigands,
        when they saw the chief.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Their demand was fair, and the chief inclined his head in sign of
        acquiescence. The eyes of all shone fiercely as they made their demand,
        and the red light of the fire made them look like demons. The names of
        all, including Carlini, were placed in a hat, and the youngest of the band
        drew forth a ticket; the ticket bore the name of Diavolaccio. He was the
        man who had proposed to Carlini the health of their chief, and to whom
        Carlini replied by breaking the glass across his face. A large wound,
        extending from the temple to the mouth, was bleeding profusely.
        Diavolaccio, seeing himself thus favored by fortune, burst into a loud
        laugh.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Captain,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;just now Carlini would not
        drink your health when I proposed it to him; propose mine to him, and let
        us see if he will be more condescending to you than to me.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Everyone expected an explosion on Carlini&rsquo;s part; but to their great
        surprise, he took a glass in one hand and a flask in the other, and
        filling it,&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Your health, Diavolaccio,&rsquo; said he calmly, and he
        drank it off, without his hand trembling in the least. Then sitting down
        by the fire, &lsquo;My supper,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;my expedition has
        given me an appetite.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Well done, Carlini!&rsquo; cried the brigands; &lsquo;that
        is acting like a good fellow;&rsquo; and they all formed a circle round
        the fire, while Diavolaccio disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Carlini ate and drank as if nothing had happened. The bandits
        looked on with astonishment at this singular conduct until they heard
        footsteps. They turned round, and saw Diavolaccio bearing the young girl
        in his arms. Her head hung back, and her long hair swept the ground. As
        they entered the circle, the bandits could perceive, by the firelight, the
        unearthly pallor of the young girl and of Diavolaccio. This apparition was
        so strange and so solemn, that everyone rose, with the exception of
        Carlini, who remained seated, and ate and drank calmly. Diavolaccio
        advanced amidst the most profound silence, and laid Rita at the captain&rsquo;s
        feet. Then everyone could understand the cause of the unearthly pallor in
        the young girl and the bandit. A knife was plunged up to the hilt in Rita&rsquo;s
        left breast. Everyone looked at Carlini; the sheath at his belt was empty.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, ah,&rsquo; said the chief, &lsquo;I now understand why
        Carlini stayed behind.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;All savage natures appreciate a desperate deed. No other of the
        bandits would, perhaps, have done the same; but they all understood what
        Carlini had done.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Now, then,&rsquo; cried Carlini, rising in his turn, and
        approaching the corpse, his hand on the butt of one of his pistols,
        &lsquo;does anyone dispute the possession of this woman with me?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;No,&rsquo; returned the chief, &lsquo;she is thine.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Carlini raised her in his arms, and carried her out of the circle
        of firelight. Cucumetto placed his sentinels for the night, and the
        bandits wrapped themselves in their cloaks, and lay down before the fire.
        At midnight the sentinel gave the alarm, and in an instant all were on the
        alert. It was Rita&rsquo;s father, who brought his daughter&rsquo;s ransom
        in person.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said he, to Cucumetto, &lsquo;here are three
        hundred piastres; give me back my child.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But the chief, without taking the money, made a sign to him to
        follow. The old man obeyed. They both advanced beneath the trees, through
        whose branches streamed the moonlight. Cucumetto stopped at last, and
        pointed to two persons grouped at the foot of a tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;There,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;demand thy child of Carlini;
        he will tell thee what has become of her;&rsquo; and he returned to his
        companions.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The old man remained motionless; he felt that some great and
        unforeseen misfortune hung over his head. At length he advanced toward the
        group, the meaning of which he could not comprehend. As he approached,
        Carlini raised his head, and the forms of two persons became visible to
        the old man&rsquo;s eyes. A woman lay on the ground, her head resting on
        the knees of a man, who was seated by her; as he raised his head, the
        woman&rsquo;s face became visible. The old man recognized his child, and
        Carlini recognized the old man.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;I expected thee,&rsquo; said the bandit to Rita&rsquo;s
        father.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Wretch!&rsquo; returned the old man, &lsquo;what hast thou
        done?&rsquo; and he gazed with terror on Rita, pale and bloody, a knife
        buried in her bosom. A ray of moonlight poured through the trees, and
        lighted up the face of the dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Cucumetto had violated thy daughter,&rsquo; said the bandit;
        &lsquo;I loved her, therefore I slew her; for she would have served as the
        sport of the whole band.&rsquo; The old man spoke not, and grew pale as
        death. &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; continued Carlini, &lsquo;if I have done
        wrongly, avenge her;&rsquo; and withdrawing the knife from the wound in
        Rita&rsquo;s bosom, he held it out to the old man with one hand, while
        with the other he tore open his vest.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Thou hast done well!&rsquo; returned the old man in a hoarse
        voice; &lsquo;embrace me, my son.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20115m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        Carlini threw himself, sobbing like a child, into the arms of his mistress&rsquo;s
        father. These were the first tears the man of blood had ever wept.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;aid me to bury my
        child.&rsquo; Carlini fetched two pickaxes; and the father and the lover
        began to dig at the foot of a huge oak, beneath which the young girl was
        to repose. When the grave was formed, the father embraced her first, and
        then the lover; afterwards, one taking the head, the other the feet, they
        placed her in the grave. Then they knelt on each side of the grave, and
        said the prayers of the dead. Then, when they had finished, they cast the
        earth over the corpse, until the grave was filled. Then, extending his
        hand, the old man said; &lsquo;I thank you, my son; and now leave me
        alone.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Yet&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; replied Carlini.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Leave me, I command you.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Carlini obeyed, rejoined his comrades, folded himself in his cloak,
        and soon appeared to sleep as soundly as the rest. It had been resolved
        the night before to change their encampment. An hour before daybreak,
        Cucumetto aroused his men, and gave the word to march. But Carlini would
        not quit the forest, without knowing what had become of Rita&rsquo;s
        father. He went toward the place where he had left him. He found the old
        man suspended from one of the branches of the oak which shaded his
        daughter&rsquo;s grave. He then took an oath of bitter vengeance over the
        dead body of the one and the tomb of the other. But he was unable to
        complete this oath, for two days afterwards, in an encounter with the
        Roman carbineers, Carlini was killed. There was some surprise, however,
        that, as he was with his face to the enemy, he should have received a ball
        between his shoulders. That astonishment ceased when one of the brigands
        remarked to his comrades that Cucumetto was stationed ten paces in Carlini&rsquo;s
        rear when he fell. On the morning of the departure from the forest of
        Frosinone he had followed Carlini in the darkness, and heard this oath of
        vengeance, and, like a wise man, anticipated it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They told ten other stories of this bandit chief, each more
        singular than the other. Thus, from Fondi to Perusia, everyone trembles at
        the name of Cucumetto.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;These narratives were frequently the theme of conversation between
        Luigi and Teresa. The young girl trembled very much at hearing the
        stories; but Vampa reassured her with a smile, tapping the butt of his
        good fowling-piece, which threw its ball so well; and if that did not
        restore her courage, he pointed to a crow, perched on some dead branch,
        took aim, touched the trigger, and the bird fell dead at the foot of the
        tree. Time passed on, and the two young people had agreed to be married
        when Vampa should be twenty and Teresa nineteen years of age. They were
        both orphans, and had only their employers&rsquo; leave to ask, which had
        been already sought and obtained. One day when they were talking over
        their plans for the future, they heard two or three reports of firearms,
        and then suddenly a man came out of the wood, near which the two young
        persons used to graze their flocks, and hurried towards them. When he came
        within hearing, he exclaimed:
      </p>
      <p>
        &lsquo;I am pursued; can you conceal me?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They knew full well that this fugitive must be a bandit; but there
        is an innate sympathy between the Roman brigand and the Roman peasant and
        the latter is always ready to aid the former. Vampa, without saying a
        word, hastened to the stone that closed up the entrance to their grotto,
        drew it away, made a sign to the fugitive to take refuge there, in a
        retreat unknown to everyone, closed the stone upon him, and then went and
        resumed his seat by Teresa. Instantly afterwards four carbineers, on
        horseback, appeared on the edge of the wood; three of them appeared to be
        looking for the fugitive, while the fourth dragged a brigand prisoner by
        the neck. The three carbineers looked about carefully on every side, saw
        the young peasants, and galloping up, began to question them. They had
        seen no one.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;That is very annoying,&rsquo; said the brigadier; for the
        man we are looking for is the chief.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Cucumetto?&rsquo; cried Luigi and Teresa at the same moment.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied the brigadier; &lsquo;and as his head is
        valued at a thousand Roman crowns, there would have been five hundred for
        you, if you had helped us to catch him.&rsquo; The two young persons
        exchanged looks. The brigadier had a moment&rsquo;s hope. Five hundred
        Roman crowns are three thousand lire, and three thousand lire are a
        fortune for two poor orphans who are going to be married.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, it is very annoying,&rsquo; said Vampa; &lsquo;but we
        have not seen him.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then the carbineers scoured the country in different directions,
        but in vain; then, after a time, they disappeared. Vampa then removed the
        stone, and Cucumetto came out. Through the crevices in the granite he had
        seen the two young peasants talking with the carbineers, and guessed the
        subject of their parley. He had read in the countenances of Luigi and
        Teresa their steadfast resolution not to surrender him, and he drew from
        his pocket a purse full of gold, which he offered to them. But Vampa
        raised his head proudly; as to Teresa, her eyes sparkled when she thought
        of all the fine gowns and gay jewellery she could buy with this purse of
        gold.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Cucumetto was a cunning fiend, and had assumed the form of a
        brigand instead of a serpent, and this look from Teresa showed to him that
        she was a worthy daughter of Eve, and he returned to the forest, pausing
        several times on his way, under the pretext of saluting his protectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Several days elapsed, and they neither saw nor heard of Cucumetto.
        The time of the Carnival was at hand. The Count of San-Felice announced a
        grand masked ball, to which all that were distinguished in Rome were
        invited. Teresa had a great desire to see this ball. Luigi asked
        permission of his protector, the steward, that she and he might be present
        amongst the servants of the house. This was granted. The ball was given by
        the Count for the particular pleasure of his daughter Carmela, whom he
        adored. Carmela was precisely the age and figure of Teresa, and Teresa was
        as handsome as Carmela. On the evening of the ball Teresa was attired in
        her best, her most brilliant ornaments in her hair, and gayest glass
        beads,&mdash;she was in the costume of the women of Frascati. Luigi wore
        the very picturesque garb of the Roman peasant at holiday time. They both
        mingled, as they had leave to do, with the servants and peasants.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The <i>festa</i> was magnificent; not only was the villa
        brilliantly illuminated, but thousands of colored lanterns were suspended
        from the trees in the garden; and very soon the palace overflowed to the
        terraces, and the terraces to the garden-walks. At each cross-path was an
        orchestra, and tables spread with refreshments; the guests stopped, formed
        quadrilles, and danced in any part of the grounds they pleased. Carmela
        was attired like a woman of Sonnino. Her cap was embroidered with pearls,
        the pins in her hair were of gold and diamonds, her girdle was of Turkey
        silk, with large embroidered flowers, her bodice and skirt were of
        cashmere, her apron of Indian muslin, and the buttons of her corset were
        of jewels. Two of her companions were dressed, the one as a woman of
        Nettuno, and the other as a woman of La Riccia. Four young men of the
        richest and noblest families of Rome accompanied them with that Italian
        freedom which has not its parallel in any other country in the world. They
        were attired as peasants of Albano, Velletri, Civita-Castellana, and Sora.
        We need hardly add that these peasant costumes, like those of the young
        women, were brilliant with gold and jewels.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Carmela wished to form a quadrille, but there was one lady wanting.
        Carmela looked all around her, but not one of the guests had a costume
        similar to her own, or those of her companions. The Count of San-Felice
        pointed out Teresa, who was hanging on Luigi&rsquo;s arm in a group of
        peasants.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Will you allow me, father?&rsquo; said Carmela.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; replied the count, &lsquo;are we not in
        Carnival time?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Carmela turned towards the young man who was talking with her, and saying
        a few words to him, pointed with her finger to Teresa. The young man looked,
        bowed in obedience, and then went to Teresa, and invited her to dance in a
        quadrille directed by the count&rsquo;s daughter. Teresa felt a flush pass
        over her face; she looked at Luigi, who could not refuse his assent. Luigi
        slowly relinquished Teresa&rsquo;s arm, which he had held beneath his own,
        and Teresa, accompanied by her elegant cavalier, took her appointed place
        with much agitation in the aristocratic quadrille. Certainly, in the eyes
        of an artist, the exact and strict costume of Teresa had a very different
        character from that of Carmela and her companions; and Teresa was
        frivolous and coquettish, and thus the embroidery and muslins, the
        cashmere waist-girdles, all dazzled her, and the reflection of sapphires
        and diamonds almost turned her giddy brain.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Luigi felt a sensation hitherto unknown arising in his mind. It was
        like an acute pain which gnawed at his heart, and then thrilled through
        his whole body. He followed with his eye each movement of Teresa and her
        cavalier; when their hands touched, he felt as though he should swoon;
        every pulse beat with violence, and it seemed as though a bell were
        ringing in his ears. When they spoke, although Teresa listened timidly and
        with downcast eyes to the conversation of her cavalier, as Luigi could
        read in the ardent looks of the good-looking young man that his language
        was that of praise, it seemed as if the whole world was turning round with
        him, and all the voices of hell were whispering in his ears ideas of
        murder and assassination. Then fearing that his paroxysm might get the
        better of him, he clutched with one hand the branch of a tree against
        which he was leaning, and with the other convulsively grasped the dagger
        with a carved handle which was in his belt, and which, unwittingly, he
        drew from the scabbard from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Luigi was jealous!
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He felt that, influenced by her ambitions and coquettish disposition,
        Teresa might escape him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The young peasant girl, at first timid and scared, soon recovered
        herself. We have said that Teresa was handsome, but this is not all;
        Teresa was endowed with all those wild graces which are so much more
        potent than our affected and studied elegancies. She had almost all the
        honors of the quadrille, and if she were envious of the Count of
        San-Felice&rsquo;s daughter, we will not undertake to say that Carmela was
        not jealous of her. And with overpowering compliments her handsome
        cavalier led her back to the place whence he had taken her, and where
        Luigi awaited her. Twice or thrice during the dance the young girl had
        glanced at Luigi, and each time she saw that he was pale and that his
        features were agitated, once even the blade of his knife, half drawn from
        its sheath, had dazzled her eyes with its sinister glare. Thus, it was
        almost tremblingly that she resumed her lover&rsquo;s arm. The quadrille
        had been most perfect, and it was evident there was a great demand for a
        repetition, Carmela alone objecting to it, but the Count of San-Felice
        besought his daughter so earnestly, that she acceded.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;One of the cavaliers then hastened to invite Teresa, without whom it was
        impossible for the quadrille to be formed, but the young girl had disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The truth was, that Luigi had not felt the strength to support another such
        trial, and, half by persuasion and half by force, he had removed Teresa toward
        another part of the garden. Teresa had yielded in spite of herself, but when she
        looked at the agitated countenance of the young man, she understood by his
        silence and trembling voice that something strange was passing within him.
        She herself was not exempt from internal emotion, and without having done
        anything wrong, yet fully comprehended that Luigi was right in reproaching
        her. Why, she did not know, but yet she did not the less feel that these
        reproaches were merited.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;However, to Teresa&rsquo;s great astonishment, Luigi remained mute,
        and not a word escaped his lips the rest of the evening. When the chill of
        the night had driven away the guests from the gardens, and the gates of
        the villa were closed on them for the <i>festa</i> in-doors, he took
        Teresa quite away, and as he left her at her home, he said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Teresa, what were you thinking of as you danced opposite the
        young Countess of San-Felice?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;I thought,&rsquo; replied the young girl, with all the
        frankness of her nature, &lsquo;that I would give half my life for a
        costume such as she wore.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;And what said your cavalier to you?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;He said it only depended on myself to have it, and I had
        only one word to say.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;He was right,&rsquo; said Luigi. &lsquo;Do you desire it as
        ardently as you say?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, then, you shall have it!&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The young girl, much astonished, raised her head to look at him,
        but his face was so gloomy and terrible that her words froze to her lips.
        As Luigi spoke thus, he left her. Teresa followed him with her eyes into
        the darkness as long as she could, and when he had quite disappeared, she
        went into the house with a sigh.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20121m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That night a memorable event occurred, due, no doubt, to the
        imprudence of some servant who had neglected to extinguish the lights. The
        Villa of San-Felice took fire in the rooms adjoining the very apartment of
        the lovely Carmela. Awakened in the night by the light of the flames, she
        sprang out of bed, wrapped herself in a dressing-gown, and attempted to
        escape by the door, but the corridor by which she hoped to fly was already
        a prey to the flames. She then returned to her room, calling for help as
        loudly as she could, when suddenly her window, which was twenty feet from
        the ground, was opened, a young peasant jumped into the chamber, seized
        her in his arms, and with superhuman skill and strength conveyed her to
        the turf of the grass-plot, where she fainted. When she recovered, her
        father was by her side. All the servants surrounded her, offering her
        assistance. An entire wing of the villa was burnt down; but what of that,
        as long as Carmela was safe and uninjured?
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Her preserver was everywhere
        sought for, but he did not appear; he was inquired after, but no one had
        seen him. Carmela was greatly troubled that she had not recognized him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As the count was immensely rich, excepting the danger Carmela had
        run,&mdash;and the marvellous manner in which she had escaped, made that appear
        to him rather a favor of Providence than a real misfortune,&mdash;the loss
        occasioned by the conflagration was to him but a trifle.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The next day, at the usual hour, the two young peasants were on the
        borders of the forest. Luigi arrived first. He came toward Teresa in high
        spirits, and seemed to have completely forgotten the events of the
        previous evening. The young girl was very pensive, but seeing Luigi so
        cheerful, she on her part assumed a smiling air, which was natural to her
        when she was not excited or in a passion.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Luigi took her arm beneath his own, and led her to the door of the grotto.
        Then he paused. The young girl, perceiving that there was something extraordinary,
        looked at him steadfastly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Teresa,&rsquo; said Luigi, &lsquo;yesterday evening you told
        me you would give all the world to have a costume similar to that of the
        count&rsquo;s daughter.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied Teresa with astonishment; &lsquo;but I
        was mad to utter such a wish.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;And I replied, &ldquo;Very well, you shall have it.&rdquo;&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied the young girl, whose astonishment
        increased at every word uttered by Luigi, &lsquo;but of course your reply
        was only to please me.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;I have promised no more than I have given you, Teresa,&rsquo;
        said Luigi proudly. &lsquo;Go into the grotto and dress yourself.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At these words he drew away the stone, and showed Teresa the grotto,
        lighted up by two wax lights, which burnt on each side of a splendid
        mirror; on a rustic table, made by Luigi, were spread out the pearl
        necklace and the diamond pins, and on a chair at the side was laid the
        rest of the costume.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Teresa uttered a cry of joy, and, without inquiring whence this
        attire came, or even thanking Luigi, darted into the grotto, transformed
        into a dressing-room.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Luigi pushed the stone behind her, for on the crest
        of a small adjacent hill which cut off the view toward Palestrina, he saw
        a traveller on horseback, stopping a moment, as if uncertain of his road,
        and thus presenting against the blue sky that perfect outline which is
        peculiar to distant objects in southern climes. When he saw Luigi, he put
        his horse into a gallop and advanced toward him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Luigi was not mistaken. The traveller, who was going from Palestrina to
        Tivoli, had mistaken his way; the young man directed him; but as at a distance of
        a quarter of a mile the road again divided into three ways, and on reaching these
        the traveller might again stray from his route, he begged Luigi to be his guide.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Luigi threw his cloak on the ground, placed his carbine on his
        shoulder, and freed from his heavy covering, preceded the traveller with
        the rapid step of a mountaineer, which a horse can scarcely keep up with.
        In ten minutes Luigi and the traveller reached the cross-roads. On
        arriving there, with an air as majestic as that of an emperor, he
        stretched his hand towards that one of the roads which the traveller was
        to follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;That is your road, excellency, and now you cannot again
        mistake.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;And here is your recompense,&rsquo; said the traveller,
        offering the young herdsman some small pieces of money.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Luigi, drawing back his hand; &lsquo;I
        render a service, I do not sell it.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; replied the traveller, who seemed used to this
        difference between the servility of a man of the cities and the pride of the
        mountaineer, &lsquo;if you refuse wages, you will, perhaps, accept a gift.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, yes, that is another thing.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the traveller, &lsquo;take these two
        Venetian sequins and give them to your bride, to make herself a pair of
        earrings.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;And then do you take this poniard,&rsquo; said the young
        herdsman; &lsquo;you will not find one better carved between Albano and
        Civita-Castellana.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;I accept it,&rsquo; answered the traveller, &lsquo;but then
        the obligation will be on my side, for this poniard is worth more than two
        sequins.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;For a dealer perhaps; but for me, who engraved it myself, it
        is hardly worth a piastre.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;What is your name?&rsquo; inquired the traveller.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Luigi Vampa,&rsquo; replied the shepherd, with the same air
        as he would have replied, Alexander, King of Macedon. &lsquo;And yours?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;I,&rsquo; said the traveller, &lsquo;am called Sinbad the
        Sailor.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz d&rsquo;Épinay started with surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sinbad the Sailor?&rdquo; he said.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the narrator; &ldquo;that was the name which
        the traveller gave to Vampa as his own.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and what may you have to say against this name?&rdquo;
        inquired Albert; &ldquo;it is a very pretty name, and the adventures of
        the gentleman of that name amused me very much in my youth, I must
        confess.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz said no more. The name of Sinbad the Sailor, as may well be
        supposed, awakened in him a world of recollections, as had the name of the
        Count of Monte Cristo on the previous evening.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Proceed!&rdquo; said he to the host.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Vampa put the two sequins haughtily into his pocket, and slowly
        returned by the way he had gone. As he came within two or three hundred
        paces of the grotto, he thought he heard a cry. He listened to know whence
        this sound could proceed. A moment afterwards he thought he heard his own
        name pronounced distinctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The cry proceeded from the grotto. He bounded like a chamois, cocking his
        carbine as he went, and in a moment reached the summit of a hill opposite to that
        on which he had perceived the traveller. Three cries for help came more distinctly
        to his ear. He cast his eyes around him and saw a man carrying off Teresa, as
        Nessus, the centaur, carried Deianira.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This man, who was hastening towards the wood, was already
        three-quarters of the way on the road from the grotto to the forest. Vampa
        measured the distance; the man was at least two hundred paces in advance
        of him, and there was not a chance of overtaking him. The young shepherd
        stopped, as if his feet had been rooted to the ground; then he put the
        butt of his carbine to his shoulder, took aim at the ravisher, followed
        him for a second in his track, and then fired.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The ravisher stopped suddenly, his knees bent under him, and he
        fell with Teresa in his arms. The young girl rose instantly, but the man
        lay on the earth struggling in the agonies of death. Vampa then rushed
        towards Teresa; for at ten paces from the dying man her legs had failed
        her, and she had dropped on her knees, so that the young man feared that
        the ball that had brought down his enemy, had also wounded his betrothed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Fortunately, she was unscathed, and it was fright alone that had
        overcome Teresa. When Luigi had assured himself that she was safe and
        unharmed, he turned towards the wounded man. He had just expired, with
        clenched hands, his mouth in a spasm of agony, and his hair on end in the
        sweat of death. His eyes remained open and menacing. Vampa approached the
        corpse, and recognized Cucumetto.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;From the day on which the bandit had been saved by the two young
        peasants, he had been enamoured of Teresa, and had sworn she should be
        his. From that time he had watched them, and profiting by the moment when
        her lover had left her alone, had carried her off, and believed he at
        length had her in his power, when the ball, directed by the unerring skill
        of the young herdsman, had pierced his heart. Vampa gazed on him for a
        moment without betraying the slightest emotion; while, on the contrary,
        Teresa, shuddering in every limb, dared not approach the slain ruffian but
        by degrees, and threw a hesitating glance at the dead body over the
        shoulder of her lover. Suddenly Vampa turned toward his mistress:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said he&mdash;&lsquo;good, good! You are dressed; it
        is now my turn to dress myself.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20125m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Teresa was clothed from head to foot in the garb of the Count of
        San-Felice&rsquo;s daughter. Vampa took Cucumetto&rsquo;s body in his arms
        and conveyed it to the grotto, while in her turn Teresa remained outside.
        If a second traveller had passed, he would have seen a strange thing,&mdash;a
        shepherdess watching her flock, clad in a cashmere grown, with ear-rings
        and necklace of pearls, diamond pins, and buttons of sapphires, emeralds,
        and rubies. He would, no doubt, have believed that he had returned to the
        times of Florian, and would have declared, on reaching Paris, that he had
        met an Alpine shepherdess seated at the foot of the Sabine Hill.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At the end of a quarter of an hour Vampa quitted the grotto; his costume
        was no less elegant than that of Teresa. He wore a vest of garnet-colored velvet,
        with buttons of cut gold; a silk waistcoat covered with embroidery; a
        Roman scarf tied round his neck; a cartridge-box worked with gold, and red
        and green silk; sky-blue velvet breeches, fastened above the knee with
        diamond buckles; garters of deerskin, worked with a thousand arabesques,
        and a hat whereon hung ribbons of all colors; two watches hung from his
        girdle, and a splendid poniard was in his belt.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Teresa uttered a cry of admiration. Vampa in this attire resembled a
        painting by Léopold Robert or Schnetz. He had assumed the entire costume of
        Cucumetto. The young man saw the effect produced on his betrothed, and a smile of
        pride passed over his lips.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; he said to Teresa, &lsquo;are you ready to share
        my fortune, whatever it may be?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, yes!&rsquo; exclaimed the young girl enthusiastically.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;And follow me wherever I go?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;To the world&rsquo;s end.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Then take my arm, and let us on; we have no time to lose.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The young girl did so without questioning her lover as to where he
        was conducting her, for he appeared to her at this moment as handsome,
        proud, and powerful as a god. They went towards the forest, and soon
        entered it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We need scarcely say that all the paths of the mountain were known
        to Vampa; he therefore went forward without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation,
        although there was no beaten track, but he knew his path by looking at the
        trees and bushes, and thus they kept on advancing for nearly an hour and a
        half. At the end of this time they had reached the thickest part of the forest.
        A torrent, whose bed was dry, led into a deep gorge. Vampa took this wild
        road, which, enclosed between two ridges, and shadowed by the tufted
        umbrage of the pines, seemed, but for the difficulties of its descent,
        that path to Avernus of which Virgil speaks. Teresa had become alarmed at
        the wild and deserted look of the plain around her, and pressed closely
        against her guide, not uttering a syllable; but as she saw him advance
        with even step and composed countenance, she endeavored to repress her
        emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Suddenly, about ten paces from them, a man advanced from behind a tree
        and aimed at Vampa.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Not another step,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;or you are a dead
        man.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;What, then,&rsquo; said Vampa, raising his hand with a
        gesture of disdain, while Teresa, no longer able to restrain her alarm,
        clung closely to him, &lsquo;do wolves rend each other?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; inquired the sentinel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;I am Luigi Vampa, shepherd of the San-Felice farm.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;I would speak with your companions who are in the glade at
        Rocca Bianca.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Follow me, then,&rsquo; said the sentinel; &lsquo;or, as you
        know your way, go first.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Vampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the
        bandit, went before Teresa, and continued to advance with the same firm
        and easy step as before. At the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a
        sign to stop. The two young persons obeyed. Then the bandit thrice
        imitated the cry of a crow; a croak answered this signal.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Good!&rsquo; said the sentry, &lsquo;you may now go on.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Luigi and Teresa again set forward; as they went on Teresa clung
        tremblingly to her lover at the sight of weapons and the glistening of
        carbines through the trees. The retreat of Rocca Bianca was at the top of
        a small mountain, which no doubt in former days had been a volcano&mdash;an
        extinct volcano before the days when Remus and Romulus had deserted Alba
        to come and found the city of Rome.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Teresa and Luigi reached the summit, and all at once found themselves in
        the presence of twenty bandits.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Here is a young man who seeks and wishes to speak to you,&rsquo;
        said the sentinel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;What has he to say?&rsquo; inquired the young man who was in
        command in the chief&rsquo;s absence.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;I wish to say that I am tired of a shepherd&rsquo;s life,&rsquo;
        was Vampa&rsquo;s reply.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, I understand,&rsquo; said the lieutenant; &lsquo;and you
        seek admittance into our ranks?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Welcome!&rsquo; cried several bandits from Ferrusino,
        Pampinara, and Anagni, who had recognized Luigi Vampa.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, but I came to ask something more than to be your
        companion.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;And what may that be?&rsquo; inquired the bandits with
        astonishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;I come to ask to be your captain,&rsquo; said the young man.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The bandits shouted with laughter.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;And what have you done to aspire to this honor?&rsquo;
        demanded the lieutenant.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;I have killed your chief, Cucumetto, whose dress I now wear;
        and I set fire to the villa San-Felice to procure a wedding-dress for my
        betrothed.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;An hour afterwards Luigi Vampa was chosen captain, vice Cucumetto,
        deceased.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20129m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, my dear Albert,&rdquo; said Franz, turning towards his
        friend; &ldquo;what think you of citizen Luigi Vampa?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I say he is a myth,&rdquo; replied Albert, &ldquo;and never had an
        existence.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what may a myth be?&rdquo; inquired Pastrini.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The explanation would be too long, my dear landlord,&rdquo; replied
        Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you say that Signor Vampa exercises his profession at this
        moment in the environs of Rome?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an
        example.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, you see, he has a good understanding with the shepherds in the
        plains, the fishermen of the Tiber, and the smugglers of the coast. They
        seek for him in the mountains, and he is on the waters; they follow him on
        the waters, and he is on the open sea; then they pursue him, and he has
        suddenly taken refuge in the islands, at Giglio, Giannutri, or Monte
        Cristo; and when they hunt for him there, he reappears suddenly at Albano,
        Tivoli, or La Riccia.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And how does he behave towards travellers?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas! his plan is very simple. It depends on the distance he may be
        from the city, whether he gives eight hours, twelve hours, or a day
        wherein to pay their ransom; and when that time has elapsed he allows
        another hour&rsquo;s grace. At the sixtieth minute of this hour, if the
        money is not forthcoming, he blows out the prisoner&rsquo;s brains with a
        pistol-shot, or plants his dagger in his heart, and that settles the
        account.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, Albert,&rdquo; inquired Franz of his companion, &ldquo;are
        you still disposed to go to the Colosseum by the outer wall?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Quite so,&rdquo; said Albert, &ldquo;if the way be picturesque.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The clock struck nine as the door opened, and a coachman appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Excellencies,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the coach is ready.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; said Franz, &ldquo;let us to the Colosseum.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By the Porta del Popolo or by the streets, your excellencies?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By the streets, <i>morbleu!</i> by the streets!&rdquo; cried Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, my dear fellow,&rdquo; said Albert, rising, and lighting his
        third cigar, &ldquo;really, I thought you had more courage.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        So saying, the two young men went down the staircase, and got into the
        carriage.
