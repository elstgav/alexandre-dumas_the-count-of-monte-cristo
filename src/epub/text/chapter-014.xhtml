      <h2>Chapter 14. The Two Prisoners</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> year after Louis
        XVIII.&rsquo;s restoration, a visit was made by the inspector-general of
        prisons. Dantès in his cell heard the noise of preparation,&mdash;sounds
        that at the depth where he lay would have been inaudible to any but the
        ear of a prisoner, who could hear the splash of the drop of water that
        every hour fell from the roof of his dungeon. He guessed something
        uncommon was passing among the living; but he had so long ceased to have
        any intercourse with the world, that he looked upon himself as dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        The inspector visited, one after another, the cells and dungeons of
        several of the prisoners, whose good behavior or stupidity recommended
        them to the clemency of the government. He inquired how they were fed, and
        if they had any request to make. The universal response was, that the fare
        was detestable, and that they wanted to be set free.
      </p>
      <p>
        The inspector asked if they had anything else to ask for. They shook their
        heads. What could they desire beyond their liberty? The inspector turned
        smilingly to the governor.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not know what reason government can assign for these useless
        visits; when you see one prisoner, you see all,&mdash;always the same
        thing,&mdash;ill fed and innocent. Are there any others?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; the dangerous and mad prisoners are in the dungeons.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us visit them,&rdquo; said the inspector with an air of
        fatigue. &ldquo;We must play the farce to the end. Let us see the
        dungeons.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us first send for two soldiers,&rdquo; said the governor.
        &ldquo;The prisoners sometimes, through mere uneasiness of life, and in
        order to be sentenced to death, commit acts of useless violence, and you
        might fall a victim.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Take all needful precautions,&rdquo; replied the inspector.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two soldiers were accordingly sent for, and the inspector descended a
        stairway, so foul, so humid, so dark, as to be loathsome to sight, smell,
        and respiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; cried the inspector, &ldquo;who can live here?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A most dangerous conspirator, a man we are ordered to keep the most
        strict watch over, as he is daring and resolute.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is alone?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How long has he been there?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nearly a year.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Was he placed here when he first arrived?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; not until he attempted to kill the turnkey, who took his food
        to him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To kill the turnkey?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, the very one who is lighting us. Is it not true, Antoine?&rdquo;
        asked the governor.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;True enough; he wanted to kill me!&rdquo; returned the turnkey.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He must be mad,&rdquo; said the inspector.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is worse than that,&mdash;he is a devil!&rdquo; returned the
        turnkey.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall I complain of him?&rdquo; demanded the inspector.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no; it is useless. Besides, he is almost mad now, and in
        another year he will be quite so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So much the better for him,&mdash;he will suffer less,&rdquo; said
        the inspector. He was, as this remark shows, a man full of philanthropy,
        and in every way fit for his office.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are right, sir,&rdquo; replied the governor; &ldquo;and this
        remark proves that you have deeply considered the subject. Now we have in
        a dungeon about twenty feet distant, and to which you descend by another
        stair, an old abbé, formerly leader of a party in Italy, who has been here
        since 1811, and in 1813 he went mad, and the change is astonishing. He
        used to weep, he now laughs; he grew thin, he now grows fat. You had
        better see him, for his madness is amusing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will see them both,&rdquo; returned the inspector; &ldquo;I must
        conscientiously perform my duty.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the inspector&rsquo;s first visit; he wished to display his authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us visit this one first,&rdquo; added he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By all means,&rdquo; replied the governor, and he signed to the
        turnkey to open the door. At the sound of the key turning in the lock, and
        the creaking of the hinges, Dantès, who was crouched in a corner of the
        dungeon, whence he could see the ray of light that came through a narrow
        iron grating above, raised his head. Seeing a stranger, escorted by two
        turnkeys holding torches and accompanied by two soldiers, and to whom the
        governor spoke bareheaded, Dantès, who guessed the truth, and that the
        moment to address himself to the superior authorities was come, sprang
        forward with clasped hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        The soldiers interposed their bayonets, for they thought that he was about
        to attack the inspector, and the latter recoiled two or three steps.
        Dantès saw that he was looked upon as dangerous. Then, infusing all the
        humility he possessed into his eyes and voice, he addressed the inspector,
        and sought to inspire him with pity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The inspector listened attentively; then, turning to the governor,
        observed, &ldquo;He will become religious&mdash;he is already more gentle;
        he is afraid, and retreated before the bayonets&mdash;madmen are not
        afraid of anything; I made some curious observations on this at Charenton.&rdquo;
        Then, turning to the prisoner, &ldquo;What is it you want?&rdquo; said he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I want to know what crime I have committed&mdash;to be tried; and
        if I am guilty, to be shot; if innocent, to be set at liberty.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you well fed?&rdquo; said the inspector.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I believe so; I don&rsquo;t know; it&rsquo;s of no consequence.
        What matters really, not only to me, but to officers of justice and the
        king, is that an innocent man should languish in prison, the victim of an
        infamous denunciation, to die here cursing his executioners.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are very humble today,&rdquo; remarked the governor; &ldquo;you
        are not so always; the other day, for instance, when you tried to kill the
        turnkey.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is true, sir, and I beg his pardon, for he has always been very
        good to me, but I was mad.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you are not so any longer?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; captivity has subdued me&mdash;I have been here so long.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So long?&mdash;when were you arrested, then?&rdquo; asked the
        inspector.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The 28th of February, 1815, at half-past two in the afternoon.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Today is the 30th of July, 1816,&mdash;why, it is but seventeen
        months.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Only seventeen months,&rdquo; replied Dantès. &ldquo;Oh, you do not
        know what is seventeen months in prison!&mdash;seventeen ages rather,
        especially to a man who, like me, had arrived at the summit of his
        ambition&mdash;to a man, who, like me, was on the point of marrying a
        woman he adored, who saw an honorable career opened before him, and who
        loses all in an instant&mdash;who sees his prospects destroyed, and is
        ignorant of the fate of his affianced wife, and whether his aged father be
        still living! Seventeen months&rsquo; captivity to a sailor accustomed to
        the boundless ocean, is a worse punishment than human crime ever merited.
        Have pity on me, then, and ask for me, not intelligence, but a trial; not
        pardon, but a verdict&mdash;a trial, sir, I ask only for a trial; that,
        surely, cannot be denied to one who is accused!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We shall see,&rdquo; said the inspector; then, turning to the
        governor, &ldquo;On my word, the poor devil touches me. You must show me
        the proofs against him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly; but you will find terrible charges.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; continued Dantès, &ldquo;I know it is not in your
        power to release me; but you can plead for me&mdash;you can have me tried&mdash;and
        that is all I ask. Let me know my crime, and the reason why I was
        condemned. Uncertainty is worse than all.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Go on with the lights,&rdquo; said the inspector.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; cried Dantès, &ldquo;I can tell by your voice you
        are touched with pity; tell me at least to hope.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I cannot tell you that,&rdquo; replied the inspector; &ldquo;I can
        only promise to examine into your case.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I am free&mdash;then I am saved!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Who arrested you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. Villefort. See him, and hear what he says.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. Villefort is no longer at Marseilles; he is now at Toulouse.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am no longer surprised at my detention,&rdquo; murmured Dantès,
        &ldquo;since my only protector is removed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Had M. de Villefort any cause of personal dislike to you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;None; on the contrary, he was very kind to me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I can, then, rely on the notes he has left concerning you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Entirely.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is well; wait patiently, then.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Dantès fell on his knees, and prayed earnestly. The door closed; but this time
        a fresh inmate was left with Dantès&mdash;Hope.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0173m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Will you see the register at once,&rdquo; asked the governor,
        &ldquo;or proceed to the other cell?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us visit them all,&rdquo; said the inspector. &ldquo;If I once
        went up those stairs. I should never have the courage to come down again.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, this one is not like the other, and his madness is less
        affecting than this one&rsquo;s display of reason.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is his folly?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He fancies he possesses an immense treasure. The first year he
        offered government a million of francs for his release; the second, two;
        the third, three; and so on progressively. He is now in his fifth year of
        captivity; he will ask to speak to you in private, and offer you five
        millions.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How curious!&mdash;what is his name?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The Abbé Faria.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No. 27,&rdquo; said the inspector.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is here; unlock the door, Antoine.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The turnkey obeyed, and the inspector gazed curiously into the chamber of
        the <i>mad abbé</i>, as the prisoner was usually called.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the centre of the cell, in a circle traced with a fragment of plaster
        detached from the wall, sat a man whose tattered garments scarcely covered
        him. He was drawing in this circle geometrical lines, and seemed as much
        absorbed in his problem as Archimedes was when the soldier of Marcellus
        slew him. He did not move at the sound of the door, and continued his calculations
        until the flash of the torches lighted up with an unwonted glare the
        sombre walls of his cell; then, raising his head, he perceived with
        astonishment the number of persons present. He hastily seized the coverlet
        of his bed, and wrapped it round him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is it you want?&rdquo; said the inspector.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I, monsieur,&rdquo; replied the abbé with an air of surprise,&mdash;&ldquo;I
        want nothing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You do not understand,&rdquo; continued the inspector; &ldquo;I am
        sent here by government to visit the prison, and hear the requests of the
        prisoners.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, that is different,&rdquo; cried the abbé; &ldquo;and we shall
        understand each other, I hope.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There, now,&rdquo; whispered the governor, &ldquo;it is just as I
        told you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; continued the prisoner, &ldquo;I am the Abbé
        Faria, born at Rome. I was for twenty years Cardinal Spada&rsquo;s
        secretary; I was arrested, why, I know not, toward the beginning of the
        year 1811; since then I have demanded my liberty from the Italian and
        French government.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why from the French government?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because I was arrested at Piombino, and I presume that, like Milan
        and Florence, Piombino has become the capital of some French department.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the inspector, &ldquo;you have not the latest news
        from Italy?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My information dates from the day on which I was arrested,&rdquo;
        returned the Abbé Faria; &ldquo;and as the emperor had created the kingdom
        of Rome for his infant son, I presume that he has realized the dream of
        Machiavelli and Cæsar Borgia, which was to make Italy a united kingdom.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; returned the inspector, &ldquo;Providence has
        changed this gigantic plan you advocate so warmly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is the only means of rendering Italy strong, happy, and
        independent.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very possibly; only I am not come to discuss politics, but to
        inquire if you have anything to ask or to complain of.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The food is the same as in other prisons,&mdash;that is, very bad;
        the lodging is very unhealthful, but, on the whole, passable for a
        dungeon; but it is not that which I wish to speak of, but a secret I have
        to reveal of the greatest importance.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We are coming to the point,&rdquo; whispered the governor.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is for that reason I am delighted to see you,&rdquo; continued
        the abbé, &ldquo;although you have disturbed me in a most important
        calculation, which, if it succeeded, would possibly change Newton&rsquo;s
        system. Could you allow me a few words in private.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; said the governor.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You knew him,&rdquo; returned the inspector with a smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What you ask is impossible, monsieur,&rdquo; continued he,
        addressing Faria.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0175m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said the abbé, &ldquo;I would speak to you of a large
        sum, amounting to five millions.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The very sum you named,&rdquo; whispered the inspector in his turn.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;However,&rdquo; continued Faria, seeing that the inspector was
        about to depart, &ldquo;it is not absolutely necessary for us to be alone;
        the governor can be present.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; said the governor, &ldquo;I know beforehand
        what you are about to say; it concerns your treasures, does it not?&rdquo;
        Faria fixed his eyes on him with an expression that would have convinced
        anyone else of his sanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;of what else should I speak?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mr. Inspector,&rdquo; continued the governor, &ldquo;I can tell you
        the story as well as he, for it has been dinned in my ears for the last
        four or five years.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That proves,&rdquo; returned the abbé, &ldquo;that you are like
        those of Holy Writ, who having eyes see not, and having ears hear not.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear sir, the government is rich and does not want your
        treasures,&rdquo; replied the inspector; &ldquo;keep them until you are
        liberated.&rdquo; The abbé&rsquo;s eyes glistened; he seized the inspector&rsquo;s
        hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But what if I am not liberated,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;and am
        detained here until my death? this treasure will be lost. Had not
        government better profit by it? I will offer six millions, and I will
        content myself with the rest, if they will only give me my liberty.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On my word,&rdquo; said the inspector in a low tone, &ldquo;had I
        not been told beforehand that this man was mad, I should believe what he
        says.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am not mad,&rdquo; replied Faria, with that acuteness of hearing
        peculiar to prisoners. &ldquo;The treasure I speak of really exists, and I
        offer to sign an agreement with you, in which I promise to lead you to the
        spot where you shall dig; and if I deceive you, bring me here again,&mdash;I
        ask no more.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The governor laughed. &ldquo;Is the spot far from here?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A hundred leagues.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is not ill-planned,&rdquo; said the governor. &ldquo;If all the
        prisoners took it into their heads to travel a hundred leagues, and their
        guardians consented to accompany them, they would have a capital chance of
        escaping.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The scheme is well known,&rdquo; said the inspector; &ldquo;and the
        abbé&rsquo;s plan has not even the merit of originality.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Then turning to Faria, &ldquo;I inquired if you are well fed?&rdquo;
        said he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Swear to me,&rdquo; replied Faria, &ldquo;to free me if what I tell
        you prove true, and I will stay here while you go to the spot.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you well fed?&rdquo; repeated the inspector.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Monsieur, you run no risk, for, as I told you, I will stay here; so
        there is no chance of my escaping.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You do not reply to my question,&rdquo; replied the inspector
        impatiently.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nor you to mine,&rdquo; cried the abbé. &ldquo;You will not accept
        my gold; I will keep it for myself. You refuse me my liberty; God will
        give it me.&rdquo; And the abbé, casting away his coverlet, resumed his
        place, and continued his calculations.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0177m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is he doing there?&rdquo; said the inspector.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Counting his treasures,&rdquo; replied the governor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Faria replied to this sarcasm with a glance of profound contempt. They
        went out. The turnkey closed the door behind them.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He was wealthy once, perhaps?&rdquo; said the inspector.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Or dreamed he was, and awoke mad.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;After all,&rdquo; said the inspector, &ldquo;if he had been rich,
        he would not have been here.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        So the matter ended for the Abbé Faria. He remained in his cell, and this
        visit only increased the belief in his insanity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Caligula or Nero, those treasure-seekers, those desirers of the
        impossible, would have accorded to the poor wretch, in exchange for his
        wealth, the liberty he so earnestly prayed for. But the kings of modern
        times, restrained by the limits of mere probability, have neither courage
        nor desire. They fear the ear that hears their orders, and the eye that
        scrutinizes their actions. Formerly they believed themselves sprung from
        Jupiter, and shielded by their birth; but nowadays they are not
        inviolable.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has always been against the policy of despotic governments to suffer
        the victims of their persecutions to reappear. As the Inquisition rarely
        allowed its victims to be seen with their limbs distorted and their flesh
        lacerated by torture, so madness is always concealed in its cell, from
        whence, should it depart, it is conveyed to some gloomy hospital, where
        the doctor has no thought for man or mind in the mutilated being the
        jailer delivers to him. The very madness of the Abbé Faria, gone mad in
        prison, condemned him to perpetual captivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The inspector kept his word with Dantès; he examined the register, and
        found the following note concerning him:
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Edmond Dantès:</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        Violent Bonapartist; took an active part in the return from Elba.
      </p>
      <p>
        The greatest watchfulness and care to be exercised.
      </p>
      <p>
        This note was in a different hand from the rest, which showed that it had
        been added since his confinement. The inspector could not contend against
        this accusation; he simply wrote, <i>Nothing to be done.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        This visit had infused new vigor into Dantès; he had, till then, forgotten
        the date; but now, with a fragment of plaster, he wrote the date, 30th
        July, 1816, and made a mark every day, in order not to lose his reckoning
        again. Days and weeks passed away, then months&mdash;Dantès still waited;
        he at first expected to be freed in a fortnight. This fortnight expired,
        he decided that the inspector would do nothing until his return to Paris,
        and that he would not reach there until his circuit was finished, he
        therefore fixed three months; three months passed away, then six more.
        Finally ten months and a half had gone by and no favorable change had
        taken place, and Dantès began to fancy the inspector&rsquo;s visit but a
        dream, an illusion of the brain.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the expiration of a year the governor was transferred; he had obtained
        charge of the fortress at Ham. He took with him several of his
        subordinates, and amongst them Dantès&rsquo; jailer. A new governor
        arrived; it would have been too tedious to acquire the names of the
        prisoners; he learned their numbers instead. This horrible place contained
        fifty cells; their inhabitants were designated by the numbers of their
        cell, and the unhappy young man was no longer called Edmond Dantès&mdash;he
        was now number 34.
