      <h2>Chapter 29. The House of Morrel &amp; Son</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nyone who had
        quitted Marseilles a few years previously, well acquainted with the
        interior of Morrel&rsquo;s warehouse, and had returned at this date, would
        have found a great change. Instead of that air of life, of comfort, and of
        happiness that permeates a flourishing and prosperous business
        establishment&mdash;instead of merry faces at the windows, busy clerks
        hurrying to and fro in the long corridors&mdash;instead of the court
        filled with bales of goods, re-echoing with the cries and the jokes of
        porters, one would have immediately perceived all aspect of sadness and
        gloom. Out of all the numerous clerks that used to fill the deserted
        corridor and the empty office, but two remained. One was a young man of
        three or four-and-twenty, who was in love with M. Morrel&rsquo;s daughter,
        and had remained with him in spite of the efforts of his friends to induce
        him to withdraw; the other was an old one-eyed cashier, called &ldquo;Cocles,&rdquo;
        or &ldquo;Cock-eye,&rdquo; a nickname given him by the young men who used
        to throng this vast now almost deserted bee-hive, and which had so
        completely replaced his real name that he would not, in all probability,
        have replied to anyone who addressed him by it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cocles remained in M. Morrel&rsquo;s service, and a most singular change
        had taken place in his position; he had at the same time risen to the rank
        of cashier, and sunk to the rank of a servant. He was, however, the same
        Cocles, good, patient, devoted, but inflexible on the subject of
        arithmetic, the only point on which he would have stood firm against the
        world, even against M. Morrel; and strong in the multiplication-table,
        which he had at his fingers&rsquo; ends, no matter what scheme or what
        trap was laid to catch him.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the midst of the disasters that befell the house, Cocles was the only one
        unmoved. But this did not arise from a want of affection; on the contrary, from
        a firm conviction. Like the rats that one by one forsake the doomed ship even
        before the vessel weighs anchor, so all the numerous clerks had by degrees
        deserted the office and the warehouse. Cocles had seen them go without thinking
        of inquiring the cause of their departure. Everything was as we have said,
        a question of arithmetic to Cocles, and during twenty years he had always
        seen all payments made with such exactitude, that it seemed as impossible to him
        that the house should stop payment, as it would to a miller that the river
        that had so long turned his mill should cease to flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing had as yet occurred to shake Cocles&rsquo; belief; the last month&rsquo;s
        payment had been made with the most scrupulous exactitude; Cocles had
        detected an overbalance of fourteen sous in his cash, and the same evening
        he had brought them to M. Morrel, who, with a melancholy smile, threw them
        into an almost empty drawer, saying:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thanks, Cocles; you are the pearl of cashiers.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Cocles went away perfectly happy, for this eulogium of M. Morrel, himself
        the pearl of the honest men of Marseilles, flattered him more than a
        present of fifty crowns. But since the end of the month M. Morrel had
        passed many an anxious hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to meet the payments then due; he had collected all his resources, and,
        fearing lest the report of his distress should get bruited abroad at Marseilles
        when he was known to be reduced to such an extremity, he went to the Beaucaire
        fair to sell his wife&rsquo;s and daughter&rsquo;s jewels and a portion of his
        plate. By this means the end of the month was passed, but his resources were now
        exhausted. Credit, owing to the reports afloat, was no longer to be had;
        and to meet the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the present
        month, and the one hundred thousand francs due on the 15th of the next
        month to M. de Boville, M. Morrel had, in reality, no hope but the return
        of the <i>Pharaon</i>, of whose departure he had learnt from a vessel
        which had weighed anchor at the same time, and which had already arrived
        in harbor.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this vessel which, like the <i>Pharaon</i>, came from Calcutta, had been in
        for a fortnight, while no intelligence had been received of the <i>Pharaon</i>.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20033m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        Such was the state of affairs when, the day after his interview with M. de
        Boville, the confidential clerk of the house of Thomson &amp; French of
        Rome, presented himself at M. Morrel&rsquo;s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emmanuel received him; this young man was alarmed by the appearance of every
        new face, for every new face might be that of a new creditor, come in anxiety
        to question the head of the house. The young man, wishing to spare his employer
        the pain of this interview, questioned the new-comer; but the stranger declared
        that he had nothing to say to M. Emmanuel, and that his business was with M.
        Morrel in person.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emmanuel sighed, and summoned Cocles. Cocles appeared, and the young man bade
        him conduct the stranger to M. Morrel&rsquo;s apartment. Cocles went first, and
        the stranger followed him. On the staircase they met a beautiful girl of sixteen
        or seventeen, who looked with anxiety at the stranger.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. Morrel is in his room, is he not, Mademoiselle Julie?&rdquo;
        said the cashier.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; I think so, at least,&rdquo; said the young girl hesitatingly.
        &ldquo;Go and see, Cocles, and if my father is there, announce this
        gentleman.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It will be useless to announce me, mademoiselle,&rdquo; returned
        the Englishman. &ldquo;M. Morrel does not know my name; this worthy
        gentleman has only to announce the confidential clerk of the house of
        Thomson &amp; French of Rome, with whom your father does business.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The young girl turned pale and continued to descend, while the stranger
        and Cocles continued to mount the staircase. She entered the office where
        Emmanuel was, while Cocles, by the aid of a key he possessed, opened a
        door in the corner of a landing-place on the second staircase, conducted
        the stranger into an antechamber, opened a second door, which he closed
        behind him, and after having left the clerk of the house of Thomson &amp;
        French alone, returned and signed to him that he could enter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Englishman entered, and found Morrel seated at a table, turning over the
        formidable columns of his ledger, which contained the list of his
        liabilities. At the sight of the stranger, M. Morrel closed the ledger,
        arose, and offered a seat to the stranger; and when he had seen him
        seated, resumed his own chair. Fourteen years had changed the worthy
        merchant, who, in his thirty-sixth year at the opening of this history,
        was now in his fiftieth; his hair had turned white, time and sorrow had
        ploughed deep furrows on his brow, and his look, once so firm and
        penetrating, was now irresolute and wandering, as if he feared being
        forced to fix his attention on some particular thought or person.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Englishman looked at him with an air of curiosity, evidently mingled with
        interest. &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Morrel, whose uneasiness was
        increased by this examination, &ldquo;you wish to speak to me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, monsieur; you are aware from whom I come?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The house of Thomson &amp; French; at least, so my cashier tells
        me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He has told you rightly. The house of Thomson &amp; French had
        300,000 or 400,000 francs to pay this month in France; and, knowing your
        strict punctuality, have collected all the bills bearing your signature,
        and charged me as they became due to present them, and to employ the money
        otherwise.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel sighed deeply, and passed his hand over his forehead, which was
        covered with perspiration.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So then, sir,&rdquo; said Morrel, &ldquo;you hold bills of mine?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, and for a considerable sum.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is the amount?&rdquo; asked Morrel with a voice he strove to
        render firm.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20035m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Here is,&rdquo; said the Englishman, taking a quantity of papers
        from his pocket, &ldquo;an assignment of 200,000 francs to our house by M.
        de Boville, the inspector of prisons, to whom they are due. You
        acknowledge, of course, that you owe this sum to him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; he placed the money in my hands at four and a half per cent
        nearly five years ago.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;When are you to pay?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Half the 15th of this month, half the 15th of next.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Just so; and now here are 32,500 francs payable shortly; they are
        all signed by you, and assigned to our house by the holders.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I recognize them,&rdquo; said Morrel, whose face was suffused, as
        he thought that, for the first time in his life, he would be unable to
        honor his own signature. &ldquo;Is this all?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I have for the end of the month these bills which have been
        assigned to us by the house of Pascal, and the house of Wild &amp; Turner
        of Marseilles, amounting to nearly 55,000 francs; in all, 287,500 francs.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        It is impossible to describe what Morrel suffered during this enumeration.
        &ldquo;Two hundred and eighty-seven thousand five hundred francs,&rdquo;
        repeated he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the Englishman. &ldquo;I will not,&rdquo;
        continued he, after a moment&rsquo;s silence, &ldquo;conceal from you,
        that while your probity and exactitude up to this moment are universally
        acknowledged, yet the report is current in Marseilles that you are not
        able to meet your liabilities.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At this almost brutal speech Morrel turned deathly pale.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;up to this time&mdash;and it is now more
        than four-and-twenty years since I received the direction of this house from
        my father, who had himself conducted it for five-and-thirty years&mdash;never
        has anything bearing the signature of Morrel &amp; Son been dishonored.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; replied the Englishman. &ldquo;But as a man of
        honor should answer another, tell me fairly, shall you pay these with the
        same punctuality?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel shuddered, and looked at the man, who spoke with more assurance than he
        had hitherto shown.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To questions frankly put,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;a straightforward answer
        should be given. Yes, I shall pay, if, as I hope, my vessel arrives safely; for
        its arrival will again procure me the credit which the numerous accidents, of
        which I have been the victim, have deprived me; but if the <i>Pharaon</i>
        should be lost, and this last resource be gone&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The poor man&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the other, &ldquo;if this last resource fail you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Morrel, &ldquo;it is a cruel thing to be
        forced to say, but, already used to misfortune, I must habituate myself to
        shame. I fear I shall be forced to suspend payment.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you no friends who could assist you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel smiled mournfully.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In business, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;one has no friends, only
        correspondents.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; murmured the Englishman; &ldquo;then you have
        but one hope.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But one.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The last?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The last.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So that if this fail&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am ruined,&mdash;completely ruined!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As I was on my way here, a vessel was coming into port.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I know it, sir; a young man, who still adheres to my fallen
        fortunes, passes a part of his time in a belvedere at the top of the
        house, in hopes of being the first to announce good news to me; he has
        informed me of the arrival of this ship.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And it is not yours?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, she is a Bordeaux vessel, <i>La Gironde</i>; she comes from
        India also; but she is not mine.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps she has spoken to the <i>Pharaon</i>, and brings you some
        tidings of her?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall I tell you plainly one thing, sir? I dread almost as much to
        receive any tidings of my vessel as to remain in doubt. Uncertainty is
        still hope.&rdquo; Then in a low voice Morrel added,&mdash;&ldquo;This
        delay is not natural. The <i>Pharaon</i> left Calcutta the 5th of
        February; she ought to have been here a month ago.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; said the Englishman. &ldquo;What is the
        meaning of that noise?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; cried Morrel, turning pale, &ldquo;what is it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        A loud noise was heard on the stairs of people moving hastily, and
        half-stifled sobs. Morrel rose and advanced to the door; but his strength
        failed him and he sank into a chair. The two men remained opposite one
        another, Morrel trembling in every limb, the stranger gazing at him with
        an air of profound pity. The noise had ceased; but it seemed that Morrel
        expected something&mdash;something had occasioned the noise, and something
        must follow. The stranger fancied he heard footsteps on the stairs; and
        that the footsteps, which were those of several persons, stopped at the
        door. A key was inserted in the lock of the first door, and the creaking
        of hinges was audible.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There are only two persons who have the key to that door,&rdquo;
        murmured Morrel, &ldquo;Cocles and Julie.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At this instant the second door opened, and the young girl, her eyes bathed
        with tears, appeared. Morrel rose tremblingly, supporting himself by the arm
        of the chair. He would have spoken, but his voice failed him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, father!&rdquo; said she, clasping her hands, &ldquo;forgive your
        child for being the bearer of evil tidings.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel again changed color. Julie threw herself into his arms.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, father, father!&rdquo; murmured she, &ldquo;courage!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The <i>Pharaon</i> has gone down, then?&rdquo; said Morrel in a
        hoarse voice. The young girl did not speak; but she made an affirmative
        sign with her head as she lay on her father&rsquo;s breast.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And the crew?&rdquo; asked Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Saved,&rdquo; said the girl; &ldquo;saved by the crew of the vessel
        that has just entered the harbor.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel raised his two hands to heaven with an expression of resignation and
        sublime gratitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thanks, my God,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;at least thou strikest but me
        alone.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        A tear moistened the eye of the phlegmatic Englishman.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come in, come in,&rdquo; said Morrel, &ldquo;for I presume you are
        all at the door.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Scarcely had he uttered those words when Madame Morrel entered weeping
        bitterly. Emmanuel followed her, and in the antechamber were visible the
        rough faces of seven or eight half-naked sailors. At the sight of these
        men the Englishman started and advanced a step; then restrained himself,
        and retired into the farthest and most obscure corner of the apartment.
        Madame Morrel sat down by her husband and took one of his hands in hers,
        Julie still lay with her head on his shoulder, Emmanuel stood in the
        centre of the chamber and seemed to form the link between Morrel&rsquo;s
        family and the sailors at the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How did this happen?&rdquo; said Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Draw nearer, Penelon,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;and tell us
        all about it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        An old seaman, bronzed by the tropical sun, advanced, twirling the remains
        of a hat between his hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Good-day, M. Morrel,&rdquo; said he, as if he had just quitted Marseilles
        the previous evening, and had just returned from Aix or Toulon.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Good-day, Penelon,&rdquo; returned Morrel, who could not refrain
        from smiling through his tears, &ldquo;where is the captain?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The captain, M. Morrel,&mdash;he has stayed behind sick at Palma;
        but please God, it won&rsquo;t be much, and you will see him in a few days
        all alive and hearty.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, now tell your story, Penelon.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20039m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        Penelon rolled his quid in his cheek, placed his hand before his mouth,
        turned his head, and sent a long jet of tobacco-juice into the
        antechamber, advanced his foot, balanced himself, and began.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You see, M. Morrel,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we were somewhere between Cape
        Blanc and Cape Boyador, sailing with a fair breeze, south-south-west after
        a week&rsquo;s calm, when Captain Gaumard comes up to me&mdash;I was at
        the helm I should tell you&mdash;and says, &lsquo;Penelon, what do you
        think of those clouds coming up over there?&rsquo; I was just then looking
        at them myself. &lsquo;What do I think, captain? Why I think that they are
        rising faster than they have any business to do, and that they would not
        be so black if they didn&rsquo;t mean mischief.&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s
        my opinion too,&rsquo; said the captain, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll take
        precautions accordingly. We are carrying too much canvas. Avast, there,
        all hands! Take in the studding-sails and stow the flying jib.&rsquo; It
        was time; the squall was on us, and the vessel began to heel. &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo;
        said the captain, &lsquo;we have still too much canvas set; all hands
        lower the mainsail!&rsquo; Five minutes after, it was down; and we sailed
        under mizzen-topsails and top-gallant sails. &lsquo;Well, Penelon,&rsquo;
        said the captain, &lsquo;what makes you shake your head?&rsquo; &lsquo;Why,&rsquo;
        I says, &lsquo;I still think you&rsquo;ve got too much on.&rsquo; &lsquo;I
        think you&rsquo;re right,&rsquo; answered he, &lsquo;we shall have a gale.&rsquo;
        &lsquo;A gale? More than that, we shall have a tempest, or I don&rsquo;t
        know what&rsquo;s what.&rsquo; You could see the wind coming like the dust
        at Montredon; luckily the captain understood his business. &lsquo;Take in
        two reefs in the top-sails,&rsquo; cried the captain; &lsquo;let go the
        bowlin&rsquo;s, haul the brace, lower the top-gallant sails, haul out the
        reef-tackles on the yards.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20041m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That was not enough for those latitudes,&rdquo; said the
        Englishman; &ldquo;I should have taken four reefs in the topsails and
        furled the spanker.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        His firm, sonorous, and unexpected voice made everyone start. Penelon put
        his hand over his eyes, and then stared at the man who thus criticized the
        manœuvres of his captain.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We did better than that, sir,&rdquo; said the old sailor respectfully;
        &ldquo;we put the helm up to run before the tempest; ten minutes after we struck
        our top-sails and scudded under bare poles.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The vessel was very old to risk that,&rdquo; said the Englishman.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Eh, it was that that did the business; after pitching heavily for
        twelve hours we sprung a leak. &lsquo;Penelon,&rsquo; said the captain,
        &lsquo;I think we are sinking, give me the helm, and go down into the
        hold.&rsquo; I gave him the helm, and descended; there was already three
        feet of water. &lsquo;All hands to the pumps!&rsquo; I shouted; but it was
        too late, and it seemed the more we pumped the more came in. &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo;
        said I, after four hours&rsquo; work, &lsquo;since we are sinking, let us
        sink; we can die but once.&rsquo; &lsquo;Is that the example you set,
        Penelon?&rsquo; cries the captain; &lsquo;very well, wait a minute.&rsquo;
        He went into his cabin and came back with a brace of pistols. &lsquo;I
        will blow the brains out of the first man who leaves the pump,&rsquo; said
        he.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well done!&rdquo; said the Englishman.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20043m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing gives you so much courage as good reasons,&rdquo;
        continued the sailor; &ldquo;and during that time the wind had abated, and
        the sea gone down, but the water kept rising; not much, only two inches an
        hour, but still it rose. Two inches an hour does not seem much, but in
        twelve hours that makes two feet, and three we had before, that makes
        five. &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said the captain, &lsquo;we have done all in our
        power, and M. Morrel will have nothing to reproach us with, we have tried
        to save the ship, let us now save ourselves. To the boats, my lads, as
        quick as you can.&rsquo; Now,&rdquo; continued Penelon, &ldquo;you see, M.
        Morrel, a sailor is attached to his ship, but still more to his life, so
        we did not wait to be told twice; the more so, that the ship was sinking
        under us, and seemed to say, &lsquo;Get along&mdash;save yourselves.&rsquo;
        We soon launched the boat, and all eight of us got into it. The captain
        descended last, or rather, he did not descend, he would not quit the
        vessel; so I took him round the waist, and threw him into the boat, and
        then I jumped after him. It was time, for just as I jumped the deck burst
        with a noise like the broadside of a man-of-war. Ten minutes after she
        pitched forward, then the other way, spun round and round, and then
        good-bye to the <i>Pharaon</i>. As for us, we were three days without
        anything to eat or drink, so that we began to think of drawing lots who
        should feed the rest, when we saw <i>La Gironde</i>; we made signals of
        distress, she perceived us, made for us, and took us all on board. There
        now, M. Morrel, that&rsquo;s the whole truth, on the honor of a sailor; is
        not it true, you fellows there?&rdquo; A general murmur of approbation
        showed that the narrator had faithfully detailed their misfortunes and
        sufferings.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; said M. Morrel, &ldquo;I know there was no one
        in fault but destiny. It was the will of God that this should happen,
        blessed be his name. What wages are due to you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t let us talk of that, M. Morrel.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but we will talk of it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, three months,&rdquo; said Penelon.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Cocles, pay two hundred francs to each of these good fellows,&rdquo;
        said Morrel. &ldquo;At another time,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;I should have
        said, Give them, besides, two hundred francs over as a present; but times
        are changed, and the little money that remains to me is not my own, so do
        not think me mean on this account.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Penelon turned to his companions, and exchanged a few words with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As for that, M. Morrel,&rdquo; said he, again turning his quid,
        &ldquo;as for that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As for what?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The money.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, we all say that fifty francs will be enough for us at
        present, and that we will wait for the rest.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thanks, my friends, thanks!&rdquo; cried Morrel gratefully; &ldquo;take
        it&mdash;take it; and if you can find another employer, enter his service;
        you are free to do so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        These last words produced a prodigious effect on the seaman. Penelon nearly
        swallowed his quid; fortunately he recovered.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What, M. Morrel!&rdquo; said he in a low voice, &ldquo;you send us away;
        you are then angry with us!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said M. Morrel, &ldquo;I am not angry, quite the
        contrary, and I do not send you away; but I have no more ships, and
        therefore I do not want any sailors.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No more ships!&rdquo; returned Penelon; &ldquo;well, then, you&rsquo;ll
        build some; we&rsquo;ll wait for you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have no money to build ships with, Penelon,&rdquo; said the poor
        owner mournfully, &ldquo;so I cannot accept your kind offer.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No more money? Then you must not pay us; we can scud, like the <i>Pharaon</i>,
        under bare poles.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Enough, enough!&rdquo; cried Morrel, almost overpowered; &ldquo;leave
        me, I pray you; we shall meet again in a happier time. Emmanuel, go with
        them, and see that my orders are executed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At least, we shall see each other again, M. Morrel?&rdquo; asked
        Penelon.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; I hope so, at least. Now go.&rdquo; He made a sign to Cocles,
        who went first; the seamen followed him and Emmanuel brought up the rear.
        &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the owner to his wife and daughter, &ldquo;leave
        me; I wish to speak with this gentleman.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20045m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        And he glanced towards the clerk of Thomson &amp; French, who had remained
        motionless in the corner during this scene, in which he had taken no part, except
        the few words we have mentioned. The two women looked at this person whose
        presence they had entirely forgotten, and retired; but, as she left the apartment,
        Julie gave the stranger a supplicating glance, to which he replied by a smile
        that an indifferent spectator would have been surprised to see on his
        stern features. The two men were left alone. &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; said
        Morrel, sinking into a chair, &ldquo;you have heard all, and I have
        nothing further to tell you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; returned the Englishman, &ldquo;that a fresh and
        unmerited misfortune has overwhelmed you, and this only increases my
        desire to serve you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, sir!&rdquo; cried Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; continued the stranger, &ldquo;I am one of your
        largest creditors.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your bills, at least, are the first that will fall due.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you wish for time to pay?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A delay would save my honor, and consequently my life.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How long a delay do you wish for?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel reflected. &ldquo;Two months,&rdquo; said he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will give you three,&rdquo; replied the stranger.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; asked Morrel, &ldquo;will the house of Thomson &amp;
        French consent?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I take everything on myself. Today is the 5th of June.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, renew these bills up to the 5th of September; and on the 5th
        of September at eleven o&rsquo;clock (the hand of the clock pointed to
        eleven), I shall come to receive the money.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall expect you,&rdquo; returned Morrel; &ldquo;and I will pay
        you&mdash;or I shall be dead.&rdquo; These last words were uttered in so
        low a tone that the stranger could not hear them. The bills were renewed,
        the old ones destroyed, and the poor ship-owner found himself with three
        months before him to collect his resources. The Englishman received his
        thanks with the phlegm peculiar to his nation; and Morrel, overwhelming
        him with grateful blessings, conducted him to the staircase. The stranger
        met Julie on the stairs; she pretended to be descending, but in reality
        she was waiting for him. &ldquo;Oh, sir&rdquo;&mdash;said she, clasping
        her hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mademoiselle,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;one day you will
        receive a letter signed &lsquo;Sinbad the Sailor.&rsquo; Do exactly what
        the letter bids you, however strange it may appear.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; returned Julie.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you promise?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I swear to you I will.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is well. Adieu, mademoiselle. Continue to be the good, sweet
        girl you are at present, and I have great hopes that Heaven will reward
        you by giving you Emmanuel for a husband.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Julie uttered a faint cry, blushed like a rose, and leaned against the
        baluster. The stranger waved his hand, and continued to descend. In the
        court he found Penelon, who, with a rouleau of a hundred francs in either
        hand, seemed unable to make up his mind to retain them. &ldquo;Come with
        me, my friend,&rdquo; said the Englishman; &ldquo;I wish to speak to you.&rdquo;
