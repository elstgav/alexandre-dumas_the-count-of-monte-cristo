      <h2>Chapter 34. The Colosseum</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ranz had so
        managed his route, that during the ride to the Colosseum they passed not a
        single ancient ruin, so that no preliminary impression interfered to
        mitigate the colossal proportions of the gigantic building they came to
        admire. The road selected was a continuation of the Via Sistina; then by
        cutting off the right angle of the street in which stands Santa Maria
        Maggiore and proceeding by the Via Urbana and San Pietro in Vincoli, the
        travellers would find themselves directly opposite the Colosseum.
      </p>
      <p>
        This itinerary possessed another great advantage,&mdash;that of leaving
        Franz at full liberty to indulge his deep reverie upon the subject of
        Signor Pastrini&rsquo;s story, in which his mysterious host of Monte
        Cristo was so strangely mixed up. Seated with folded arms in a corner of
        the carriage, he continued to ponder over the singular history he had so
        lately listened to, and to ask himself an interminable number of questions
        touching its various circumstances without, however, arriving at a
        satisfactory reply to any of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        One fact more than the rest brought his friend &ldquo;Sinbad the Sailor&rdquo;
        back to his recollection, and that was the mysterious sort of intimacy
        that seemed to exist between the brigands and the sailors; and Pastrini&rsquo;s
        account of Vampa&rsquo;s having found refuge on board the vessels of
        smugglers and fishermen, reminded Franz of the two Corsican bandits he had
        found supping so amicably with the crew of the little yacht, which had
        even deviated from its course and touched at Porto-Vecchio for the sole
        purpose of landing them. The very name assumed by his host of Monte Cristo
        and again repeated by the landlord of the Hôtel de Londres, abundantly
        proved to him that his island friend was playing his philanthropic part on
        the shores of Piombino, Civita Vecchia, Ostia, and Gaëta, as on those of
        Corsica, Tuscany, and Spain; and further, Franz bethought him of having
        heard his singular entertainer speak both of Tunis and Palermo, proving
        thereby how largely his circle of acquaintances extended.
      </p>
      <p>
        But however the mind of the young man might be absorbed in these
        reflections, they were at once dispersed at the sight of the dark frowning
        ruins of the stupendous Colosseum, through the various openings of which
        the pale moonlight played and flickered like the unearthly gleam from the
        eyes of the wandering dead. The carriage stopped near the Meta Sudans; the
        door was opened, and the young men, eagerly alighting, found themselves
        opposite a <i>cicerone</i>, who appeared to have sprung up from the
        ground, so unexpected was his appearance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The usual guide from the hotel having followed them, they had paid two
        conductors, nor is it possible, at Rome, to avoid this abundant supply of
        guides; besides the ordinary <i>cicerone</i>, who seizes upon you directly
        you set foot in your hotel, and never quits you while you remain in the
        city, there is also a special <i>cicerone</i> belonging to each monument&mdash;nay,
        almost to each part of a monument. It may, therefore, be easily imagined
        there is no scarcity of guides at the Colosseum, that wonder of all ages,
        which Martial thus eulogizes:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let Memphis cease to boast the barbarous miracles of her pyramids,
        and the wonders of Babylon be talked of no more among us; all must bow to
        the superiority of the gigantic labor of the Cæsars, and the many voices
        of Fame spread far and wide the surpassing merits of this incomparable
        monument.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        As for Albert and Franz, they essayed not to escape from their <i>ciceronian</i>
        tyrants; and, indeed, it would have been so much the more difficult to
        break their bondage, as the guides alone are permitted to visit these
        monuments with torches in their hands. Thus, then, the young men made no
        attempt at resistance, but blindly and confidingly surrendered themselves
        into the care and custody of their conductors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz had already made seven or eight similar excursions to the Colosseum,
        while his less favored companion trod for the first time in his life the
        classic ground forming the monument of Flavius Vespasian; and, to his
        credit be it spoken, his mind, even amid the glib loquacity of the guides,
        was duly and deeply touched with awe and enthusiastic admiration of all he
        saw; and certainly no adequate notion of these stupendous ruins can be
        formed save by such as have visited them, and more especially by
        moonlight, at which time the vast proportions of the building appear twice
        as large when viewed by the mysterious beams of a southern moonlit sky,
        whose rays are sufficiently clear and vivid to light the horizon with a
        glow equal to the soft twilight of a western clime.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scarcely, therefore, had the reflective Franz walked a hundred steps
        beneath the interior porticoes of the ruin, when, abandoning Albert to the
        guides (who would by no means yield their prescriptive right of carrying
        their victims through the routine regularly laid down, and as regularly
        followed by them, but dragged the unconscious visitor to the various
        objects with a pertinacity that admitted of no appeal, beginning, as a
        matter of course, with the &ldquo;Lions&rsquo; Den&rdquo;, the &ldquo;Hall
        of the Gladiators&rdquo; and finishing with &ldquo;Cæsar&rsquo;s Podium&rdquo;),
        to escape a jargon and mechanical survey of the wonders by which he was
        surrounded, Franz ascended a half-dilapidated staircase, and, leaving them
        to follow their monotonous round, seated himself at the foot of a column,
        and immediately opposite a large aperture, which permitted him to enjoy a
        full and undisturbed view of the gigantic dimensions of the majestic ruin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz had remained for nearly a quarter of an hour perfectly hidden by the
        shadow of the vast column at whose base he had found a resting-place, and
        from whence his eyes followed the motions of Albert and his guides, who,
        holding torches in their hands, had emerged from a vomitorium at the
        opposite extremity of the Colosseum, and then again disappeared down the
        steps conducting to the seats reserved for the Vestal virgins, resembling,
        as they glided along, some restless shades following the flickering glare
        of so many <i>ignes fatui</i>. All at once his ear caught a sound
        resembling that of a stone rolling down the staircase opposite the one by
        which he had himself ascended. There was nothing remarkable in the
        circumstance of a fragment of granite giving way and falling heavily
        below; but it seemed to him that the substance that fell gave way beneath
        the pressure of a foot, and also that someone, who endeavored as much as
        possible to prevent his footsteps from being heard, was approaching the
        spot where he sat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conjecture soon became certainty, for the figure of a man was distinctly visible
        to Franz, gradually emerging from the staircase opposite, upon which the moon
        was at that moment pouring a full tide of silvery brightness.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stranger thus presenting himself was probably a person who, like
        Franz, preferred the enjoyment of solitude and his own thoughts to the
        frivolous gabble of the guides. And his appearance had nothing
        extraordinary in it; but the hesitation with which he proceeded, stopping
        and listening with anxious attention at every step he took, convinced
        Franz that he expected the arrival of some person.
      </p>
      <p>
        By a sort of instinctive impulse, Franz withdrew as much as possible behind
        his pillar.
      </p>
      <p>
        About ten feet from the spot where he and the stranger were, the roof had
        given way, leaving a large round opening, through which might be seen the
        blue vault of heaven, thickly studded with stars.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around this opening, which had, possibly, for ages permitted a free
        entrance to the brilliant moonbeams that now illumined the vast pile, grew
        a quantity of creeping plants, whose delicate green branches stood out in
        bold relief against the clear azure of the firmament, while large masses
        of thick, strong fibrous shoots forced their way through the chasm, and
        hung floating to and fro, like so many waving strings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The person whose mysterious arrival had attracted the attention of Franz
        stood in a kind of half-light, that rendered it impossible to distinguish
        his features, although his dress was easily made out. He wore a large
        brown mantle, one fold of which, thrown over his left shoulder, served
        likewise to mask the lower part of his countenance, while the upper part
        was completely hidden by his broad-brimmed hat. The lower part of his
        dress was more distinctly visible by the bright rays of the moon, which,
        entering through the broken ceiling, shed their refulgent beams on feet
        cased in elegantly made boots of polished leather, over which descended
        fashionably cut trousers of black cloth.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20135m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        From the imperfect means Franz had of judging, he could only come to one
        conclusion,&mdash;that the person whom he was thus watching certainly
        belonged to no inferior station of life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some few minutes had elapsed, and the stranger began to show manifest
        signs of impatience, when a slight noise was heard outside the aperture in
        the roof, and almost immediately a dark shadow seemed to obstruct the
        flood of light that had entered it, and the figure of a man was clearly
        seen gazing with eager scrutiny on the immense space beneath him; then, as
        his eye caught sight of him in the mantle, he grasped a floating mass of
        thickly matted boughs, and glided down by their help to within three or
        four feet of the ground, and then leaped lightly on his feet. The man who
        had performed this daring act with so much indifference wore the
        Transtevere costume.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I beg your excellency&rsquo;s pardon for keeping you waiting,&rdquo;
        said the man, in the Roman dialect, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m
        many minutes after my time, ten o&rsquo;clock has just struck by the clock
        of Saint John Lateran.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Say not a word about being late,&rdquo; replied the stranger in
        purest Tuscan; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis I who am too soon. But even if you had
        caused me to wait a little while, I should have felt quite sure that the
        delay was not occasioned by any fault of yours.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your excellency is perfectly right in so thinking,&rdquo; said the
        man; &ldquo;I came here direct from the Castle of St. Angelo, and I had an
        immense deal of trouble before I could get a chance to speak to Beppo.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And who is Beppo?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, Beppo is employed in the prison, and I give him so much a year
        to let me know what is going on within his holiness&rsquo;s castle.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed! You are a provident person, I see.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, you see, no one knows what may happen. Perhaps some of these
        days I may be entrapped, like poor Peppino and may be very glad to have
        some little nibbling mouse to gnaw the meshes of my net, and so help me
        out of prison.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Briefly, what did you learn?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That two executions of considerable interest will take place the
        day after tomorrow at two o&rsquo;clock, as is customary at Rome at the
        commencement of all great festivals. One of the culprits will be
        <i>mazzolato</i>;<a href="#linknote-3" name="linknoteref-3" id="linknoteref-3">3</a>
        he is an atrocious villain, who murdered the priest who brought him
        up, and deserves not the smallest pity. The other sufferer is sentenced to
        be <i>decapitato</i>;<a href="#linknote-4" name="linknoteref-4" id="linknoteref-4">4</a>
        and he, your excellency, is poor Peppino.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The fact is, that you have inspired not only the pontifical
        government, but also the neighboring states, with such extreme fear, that
        they are glad of all opportunity of making an example.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But Peppino did not even belong to my band; he was merely a poor
        shepherd, whose only crime consisted in furnishing us with provisions.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Which makes him your accomplice to all intents and purposes. But
        mark the distinction with which he is treated; instead of being knocked on
        the head as you would be if once they caught hold of you, he is simply
        sentenced to be guillotined, by which means, too, the amusements of the
        day are diversified, and there is a spectacle to please every spectator.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Without reckoning the wholly unexpected one I am preparing to
        surprise them with.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; said the man in the cloak, &ldquo;excuse me
        for saying that you seem to me precisely in the mood to commit some wild
        or extravagant act.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps I am; but one thing I have resolved on, and that is, to
        stop at nothing to restore a poor devil to liberty, who has got into this
        scrape solely from having served me. I should hate and despise myself as a
        coward did I desert the brave fellow in his present extremity.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what do you mean to do?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To surround the scaffold with twenty of my best men, who, at a
        signal from me, will rush forward directly Peppino is brought for
        execution, and, by the assistance of their stilettos, drive back the
        guard, and carry off the prisoner.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That seems to me as hazardous as uncertain, and convinces me that
        my scheme is far better than yours.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what is your excellency&rsquo;s project?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Just this. I will so advantageously bestow 2,000 piastres, that the
        person receiving them shall obtain a respite till next year for Peppino;
        and during that year, another skilfully placed 1,000 piastres will afford
        him the means of escaping from his prison.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And do you feel sure of succeeding?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Pardieu!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed the man in the cloak, suddenly
        expressing himself in French.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What did your excellency say?&rdquo; inquired the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I said, my good fellow, that I would do more single-handed by the
        means of gold than you and all your troop could effect with stilettos,
        pistols, carbines, and blunderbusses included. Leave me, then, to act, and
        have no fears for the result.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At least, there can be no harm in myself and party being in
        readiness, in case your excellency should fail.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;None whatever. Take what precautions you please, if it is any
        satisfaction to you to do so; but rely upon my obtaining the reprieve I
        seek.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Remember, the execution is fixed for the day after tomorrow, and
        that you have but one day to work in.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what of that? Is not a day divided into twenty-four hours, each
        hour into sixty minutes, and every minute sub-divided into sixty seconds?
        Now in 86,400 seconds very many things can be done.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And how shall I know whether your excellency has succeeded or not.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, that is very easily arranged. I have engaged the three lower
        windows at the Café Rospoli; should I have obtained the requisite pardon
        for Peppino, the two outside windows will be hung with yellow damasks, and
        the centre with white, having a large cross in red marked on it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And whom will you employ to carry the reprieve to the officer
        directing the execution?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Send one of your men, disguised as a penitent friar, and I will
        give it to him. His dress will procure him the means of approaching the
        scaffold itself, and he will deliver the official order to the officer,
        who, in his turn, will hand it to the executioner; in the meantime, it
        will be as well to acquaint Peppino with what we have determined on, if it
        be only to prevent his dying of fear or losing his senses, because in
        either case a very useless expense will have been incurred.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your excellency,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;you are fully
        persuaded of my entire devotion to you, are you not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nay, I flatter myself that there can be no doubt of it,&rdquo;
        replied the cavalier in the cloak.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, only fulfil your promise of rescuing Peppino, and
        henceforward you shall receive not only devotion, but the most absolute
        obedience from myself and those under me that one human being can render
        to another.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have a care how far you pledge yourself, my good friend, for I may
        remind you of your promise at some, perhaps, not very distant period, when
        I, in my turn, may require your aid and influence.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let that day come sooner or later, your excellency will find me
        what I have found you in this my heavy trouble; and if from the other end
        of the world you but write me word to do such or such a thing, you may
        regard it as done, for done it shall be, on the word and faith of&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; interrupted the stranger; &ldquo;I hear a noise.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis some travellers, who are visiting the Colosseum by
        torchlight.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&rsquo;Twere better we should not be seen together; those guides
        are nothing but spies, and might possibly recognize you; and, however I
        may be honored by your friendship, my worthy friend, if once the extent of
        our intimacy were known, I am sadly afraid both my reputation and credit
        would suffer thereby.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, if you obtain the reprieve?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The middle window at the Café Rospoli will be hung with white
        damask, bearing a red cross.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And if you fail?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then all three windows will have yellow draperies.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And then?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And then, my good fellow, use your daggers in any way you please,
        and I further promise you to be there as a spectator of your prowess.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We understand each other perfectly, then. Adieu, your excellency;
        depend upon me as firmly as I do upon you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Saying these words, the Transteverin disappeared down the staircase, while
        his companion, muffling his features more closely than before in the folds
        of his mantle, passed almost close to Franz, and descended to the arena by
        an outward flight of steps. The next minute Franz heard himself called by
        Albert, who made the lofty building re-echo with the sound of his friend&rsquo;s
        name. Franz, however, did not obey the summons till he had satisfied
        himself that the two men whose conversation he had overheard were at a
        sufficient distance to prevent his encountering them in his descent. In
        ten minutes after the strangers had departed, Franz was on the road to the
        Piazza di Spagna, listening with studied indifference to the learned
        dissertation delivered by Albert, after the manner of Pliny and
        Calpurnius, touching the iron-pointed nets used to prevent the ferocious
        beasts from springing on the spectators.

      <p>
        Franz let him proceed without interruption, and, in fact, did not hear
        what was said; he longed to be alone, and free to ponder over all that had
        occurred. One of the two men, whose mysterious meeting in the Colosseum he
        had so unintentionally witnessed, was an entire stranger to him, but not
        so the other; and though Franz had been unable to distinguish his
        features, from his being either wrapped in his mantle or obscured by the
        shadow, the tones of his voice had made too powerful an impression on him
        the first time he had heard them for him ever again to forget them, hear
        them when or where he might. It was more especially when this man was
        speaking in a manner half jesting, half bitter, that Franz&rsquo;s ear
        recalled most vividly the deep sonorous, yet well-pitched voice that had
        addressed him in the grotto of Monte Cristo, and which he heard for the
        second time amid the darkness and ruined grandeur of the Colosseum. And
        the more he thought, the more entire was his conviction, that the person
        who wore the mantle was no other than his former host and entertainer,
        &ldquo;Sinbad the Sailor.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20139m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        Under any other circumstances, Franz would have found it impossible to
        resist his extreme curiosity to know more of so singular a personage, and
        with that intent have sought to renew their short acquaintance; but in the
        present instance, the confidential nature of the conversation he had
        overheard made him, with propriety, judge that his appearance at such a
        time would be anything but agreeable. As we have seen, therefore, he
        permitted his former host to retire without attempting a recognition, but
        fully promising himself a rich indemnity for his present forbearance
        should chance afford him another opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In vain did Franz endeavor to forget the many perplexing thoughts which
        assailed him; in vain did he court the refreshment of sleep. Slumber
        refused to visit his eyelids and the night was passed in feverish
        contemplation of the chain of circumstances tending to prove the identity
        of the mysterious visitant to the Colosseum with the inhabitant of the
        grotto of Monte Cristo; and the more he thought, the firmer grew his
        opinion on the subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        Worn out at length, he fell asleep at daybreak, and did not awake till
        late. Like a genuine Frenchman, Albert had employed his time in arranging
        for the evening&rsquo;s diversion; he had sent to engage a box at the
        Teatro Argentina; and Franz, having a number of letters to write,
        relinquished the carriage to Albert for the whole of the day.
      </p>
      <p>
        At five o&rsquo;clock Albert returned, delighted with his day&rsquo;s
        work; he had been occupied in leaving his letters of introduction, and had
        received in return more invitations to balls and routs than it would be
        possible for him to accept; besides this, he had seen (as he called it)
        all the remarkable sights at Rome. Yes, in a single day he had
        accomplished what his more serious-minded companion would have taken weeks
        to effect. Neither had he neglected to ascertain the name of the piece to
        be played that night at the Teatro Argentina, and also what performers
        appeared in it. The opera of <i>Parisina</i> was announced for representation,
        and the principal actors were Coselli, Moriani, and La Specchia.
      </p>
      <p>
        The young men, therefore, had reason to consider themselves fortunate in having
        the opportunity of hearing one of the best works by the composer of <i>Lucia
        di Lammermoor</i>, supported by three of the most renowned vocalists of Italy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Albert had never been able to endure the Italian theatres, with
        their orchestras from which it is impossible to see, and the absence of
        balconies, or open boxes; all these defects pressed hard on a man who had
        had his stall at the Bouffes, and had shared a lower box at the Opera.
        Still, in spite of this, Albert displayed his most dazzling and effective
        costumes each time he visited the theatres; but, alas, his elegant toilet
        was wholly thrown away, and one of the most worthy representatives of
        Parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying reflection that he
        had nearly overrun Italy without meeting with a single adventure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes Albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success; but
        internally he was deeply wounded, and his self-love immensely piqued, to
        think that Albert de Morcerf, the most admired and most sought after of
        any young person of his day, should thus be passed over, and merely have
        his labor for his pains. And the thing was so much the more annoying, as,
        according to the characteristic modesty of a Frenchman, Albert had quitted
        Paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself in Italy
        to carry all before him, and that upon his return he should astonish the
        Parisian world with the recital of his numerous love-affairs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alas, poor Albert! None of those interesting adventures fell in his way;
        the lovely Genoese, Florentines, and Neapolitans were all faithful, if not
        to their husbands, at least to their lovers, and thought not of changing
        even for the splendid appearance of Albert de Morcerf; and all he gained
        was the painful conviction that the ladies of Italy have this advantage
        over those of France, that they are faithful even in their infidelity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet he could not restrain a hope that in Italy, as elsewhere, there might
        be an exception to the general rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        Albert, besides being an elegant, well-looking young man, was also
        possessed of considerable talent and ability; moreover, he was a viscount&mdash;a
        recently created one, certainly, but in the present day it is not
        necessary to go as far back as Noah in tracing a descent, and a
        genealogical tree is equally estimated, whether dated from 1399 or merely
        1815; but to crown all these advantages, Albert de Morcerf commanded an
        income of 50,000 livres, a more than sufficient sum to render him a
        personage of considerable importance in Paris. It was therefore no small
        mortification to him to have visited most of the principal cities in Italy
        without having excited the most trifling observation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Albert, however, hoped to indemnify himself for all these slights and indifferences
        during the Carnival, knowing full well that among the different states and
        kingdoms in which this festivity is celebrated, Rome is the spot where
        even the wisest and gravest throw off the usual rigidity of their lives,
        and deign to mingle in the follies of this time of liberty and relaxation.
        The Carnival was to commence on the morrow; therefore Albert had not an
        instant to lose in setting forth the programme of his hopes, expectations,
        and claims to notice.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this design he had engaged a box in the most conspicuous part of the theatre,
        and exerted himself to set off his personal attractions by the aid of the most
        rich and elaborate toilet. The box taken by Albert was in the first circle;
        although each of the three tiers of boxes is deemed equally aristocratic, and is,
        for this reason, generally styled the &ldquo;nobility&rsquo;s boxes,&rdquo; and
        although the box engaged for the two friends was sufficiently capacious to contain
        at least a dozen persons, it had cost less than would be paid at some of
        the French theatres for one admitting merely four occupants.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another motive had influenced Albert&rsquo;s selection of his seat,&mdash;who knew
        but that, thus advantageously placed, he might not in truth attract the
        notice of some fair Roman, and an introduction might ensue that would
        procure him the offer of a seat in a carriage, or a place in a princely
        balcony, from which he might behold the gayeties of the Carnival?
      </p>
      <p>
        These united considerations made Albert more lively and anxious to please
        than he had hitherto been. Totally disregarding the business of the stage,
        he leaned from his box and began attentively scrutinizing the beauty of
        each pretty woman, aided by a powerful opera-glass; but, alas, this
        attempt to attract notice wholly failed; not even curiosity had been
        excited, and it was but too apparent that the lovely creatures, into whose
        good graces he was desirous of stealing, were all so much engrossed with
        themselves, their lovers, or their own thoughts, that they had not so much
        as noticed him or the manipulation of his glass.
      </p>
      <p>
        The truth was, that the anticipated pleasures of the Carnival, with the
        &ldquo;Holy Week&rdquo; that was to succeed it, so filled every fair
        breast, as to prevent the least attention being bestowed even on the
        business of the stage. The actors made their entries and exits unobserved
        or unthought of; at certain conventional moments, the spectators would
        suddenly cease their conversation, or rouse themselves from their musings,
        to listen to some brilliant effort of Moriani&rsquo;s, a well-executed
        recitative by Coselli, or to join in loud applause at the wonderful powers
        of La Specchia; but that momentary excitement over, they quickly relapsed
        into their former state of preoccupation or interesting conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Towards the close of the first act, the door of a box which had been
        hitherto vacant was opened; a lady entered to whom Franz had been
        introduced in Paris, where indeed, he had imagined she still was. The
        quick eye of Albert caught the involuntary start with which his friend
        beheld the new arrival, and, turning to him, he said hastily:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know the woman who has just entered that box?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; what do you think of her?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, she is perfectly lovely&mdash;what a complexion! And such
        magnificent hair! Is she French?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; a Venetian.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And her name is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Countess G&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, I know her by name!&rdquo; exclaimed Albert; &ldquo;she is said
        to possess as much wit and cleverness as beauty. I was to have been
        presented to her when I met her at Madame Villefort&rsquo;s ball.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall I assist you in repairing your negligence?&rdquo; asked
        Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear fellow, are you really on such good terms with her as to
        venture to take me to her box?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, I have only had the honor of being in her society and
        conversing with her three or four times in my life; but you know that even
        such an acquaintance as that might warrant my doing what you ask.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At that instant, the countess perceived Franz, and graciously waved her
        hand to him, to which he replied by a respectful inclination of the head.
        &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said Albert, &ldquo;you seem to be on
        excellent terms with the beautiful countess.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are mistaken in thinking so,&rdquo; returned Franz calmly;
        &ldquo;but you merely fall into the same error which leads so many of our
        countrymen to commit the most egregious blunders,&mdash;I mean that of
        judging the habits and customs of Italy and Spain by our Parisian notions;
        believe me, nothing is more fallacious than to form any estimate of the
        degree of intimacy you may suppose existing among persons by the familiar
        terms they seem upon; there is a similarity of feeling at this instant
        between ourselves and the countess&mdash;nothing more.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is there, indeed, my good fellow? Pray tell me, is it sympathy of
        heart?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; of taste,&rdquo; continued Franz gravely.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And in what manner has this congeniality of mind been evinced?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By the countess&rsquo;s visiting the Colosseum, as we did last
        night, by moonlight, and nearly alone.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You were with her, then?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I was.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what did you say to her?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, we talked of the illustrious dead of whom that magnificent ruin
        is a glorious monument!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; cried Albert, &ldquo;you must have been a very
        entertaining companion alone, or all but alone, with a beautiful woman in
        such a place of sentiment as the Colosseum, and yet to find nothing better
        to talk about than the dead! All I can say is, if ever I should get such a
        chance, the living should be my theme.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20143m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you will probably find your theme ill-chosen.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Albert, breaking in upon his discourse, &ldquo;never
        mind the past; let us only remember the present. Are you not going to keep
        your promise of introducing me to the fair subject of our remarks?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly, directly the curtain falls on the stage.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What a confounded long time this first act lasts. I believe, on my
        soul, that they never mean to finish it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, they will; only listen to that charming finale. How
        exquisitely Coselli sings his part.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But what an awkward, inelegant fellow he is.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, what do you say to La Specchia? Did you ever see
        anything more perfect than her acting?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, you know, my dear fellow, when one has been accustomed to
        Malibran and Sontag, such singers as these don&rsquo;t make the same
        impression on you they perhaps do on others.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At least, you must admire Moriani&rsquo;s style and execution.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I never fancied men of his dark, ponderous appearance singing with
        a voice like a woman&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My good friend,&rdquo; said Franz, turning to him, while Albert
        continued to point his glass at every box in the theatre, &ldquo;you seem
        determined not to approve; you are really too difficult to please.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The curtain at length fell on the performances, to the infinite
        satisfaction of the Viscount of Morcerf, who seized his hat, rapidly
        passed his fingers through his hair, arranged his cravat and wristbands,
        and signified to Franz that he was waiting for him to lead the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz, who had mutely interrogated the countess, and received from her a gracious
        smile in token that he would be welcome, sought not to retard the
        gratification of Albert&rsquo;s eager impatience, but began at once the
        tour of the house, closely followed by Albert, who availed himself of the
        few minutes required to reach the opposite side of the theatre to settle
        the height and smoothness of his collar, and to arrange the lappets of his
        coat. This important task was just completed as they arrived at the
        countess&rsquo;s box.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the knock, the door was immediately opened, and the young man who was seated
        beside the countess, in obedience to the Italian custom, instantly rose and
        surrendered his place to the strangers, who, in turn, would be expected to
        retire upon the arrival of other visitors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz presented Albert as one of the most distinguished young men of the
        day, both as regarded his position in society and extraordinary talents;
        nor did he say more than the truth, for in Paris and the circle in which
        the viscount moved, he was looked upon and cited as a model of perfection.
        Franz added that his companion, deeply grieved at having been prevented
        the honor of being presented to the countess during her sojourn in Paris,
        was most anxious to make up for it, and had requested him (Franz) to
        remedy the past misfortune by conducting him to her box, and concluded by
        asking pardon for his presumption in having taken it upon himself to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        The countess, in reply, bowed gracefully to Albert, and extended her
        hand with cordial kindness to Franz; then, inviting Albert to take the
        vacant seat beside her, she recommended Franz to take the next best, if he
        wished to view the ballet, and pointed to the one behind her own chair.
      </p>
      <p>
        Albert was soon deeply engrossed in discoursing upon Paris and Parisian
        matters, speaking to the countess of the various persons they both knew
        there. Franz perceived how completely he was in his element; and,
        unwilling to interfere with the pleasure he so evidently felt, took up
        Albert&rsquo;s glass, and began in his turn to survey the audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sitting alone, in the front of a box immediately opposite, but situated on
        the third row, was a woman of exquisite beauty, dressed in a Greek
        costume, which evidently, from the ease and grace with which she wore it,
        was her national attire. Behind her, but in deep shadow, was the outline
        of a masculine figure; but the features of this latter personage it was
        not possible to distinguish. Franz could not forbear breaking in upon the
        apparently interesting conversation passing between the countess and
        Albert, to inquire of the former if she knew who was the fair Albanian
        opposite, since beauty such as hers was well worthy of being observed by
        either sex.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;All I can tell about her,&rdquo; replied the countess, &ldquo;is,
        that she has been at Rome since the beginning of the season; for I saw her
        where she now sits the very first night of the season, and since then she
        has never missed a performance. Sometimes she is accompanied by the person
        who is now with her, and at others she is merely attended by a black
        servant.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what do you think of her personal appearance?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I consider her perfectly lovely&mdash;she is just my idea of
        what Medora must have been.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz and the countess exchanged a smile, and then the latter resumed her
        conversation with Albert, while Franz returned to his previous survey of
        the house and company. The curtain rose on the ballet, which was one of
        those excellent specimens of the Italian school, admirably arranged and
        put on the stage by Henri, who has established for himself a great
        reputation throughout Italy for his taste and skill in the choreographic
        art&mdash;one of those masterly productions of grace, method, and elegance
        in which the whole <i>corps de ballet</i>, from the principal dancers to
        the humblest supernumerary, are all engaged on the stage at the same time;
        and a hundred and fifty persons may be seen exhibiting the same attitude,
        or elevating the same arm or leg with a simultaneous movement, that would
        lead you to suppose that but one mind, one act of volition, influenced the
        moving mass.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ballet was called <i>Poliska</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        However much the ballet might have claimed his attention, Franz was too
        deeply occupied with the beautiful Greek to take any note of it; while she
        seemed to experience an almost childlike delight in watching it, her
        eager, animated looks contrasting strongly with the utter indifference of
        her companion, who, during the whole time the piece lasted, never even
        moved, not even when the furious, crashing din produced by the trumpets,
        cymbals, and Chinese bells sounded their loudest from the orchestra. Of
        this he took no heed, but was, as far as appearances might be trusted,
        enjoying soft repose and bright celestial dreams.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ballet at length came to a close, and the curtain fell amid the loud,
        unanimous plaudits of an enthusiastic and delighted audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Owing to the very judicious plan of dividing the two acts of the opera
        with a ballet, the pauses between the performances are very short, the
        singers in the opera having time to repose themselves and change their
        costume, when necessary, while the dancers are executing their pirouettes
        and exhibiting their graceful steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        The overture to the second act began; and, at the first sound of the
        leader&rsquo;s bow across his violin, Franz observed the sleeper slowly
        arise and approach the Greek girl, who turned around to say a few words to
        him, and then, leaning forward again on the railing of her box, she became
        as absorbed as before in what was going on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The countenance of the person who had addressed her remained so completely
        in the shade, that, though Franz tried his utmost, he could not
        distinguish a single feature. The curtain rose, and the attention of Franz
        was attracted by the actors; and his eyes turned from the box containing
        the Greek girl and her strange companion to watch the business of the
        stage.

        Most of my readers are aware that the second act of <i>Parisina</i> opens
        with the celebrated and effective duet in which Parisina, while sleeping,
        betrays to Azzo the secret of her love for Ugo. The injured husband goes
        through all the emotions of jealousy, until conviction seizes on his mind,
        and then, in a frenzy of rage and indignation, he awakens his guilty wife
        to tell her that he knows her guilt and to threaten her with his
        vengeance.
      </p>
      <p>
        This duet is one of the most beautiful, expressive and terrible
        conceptions that has ever emanated from the fruitful pen of Donizetti.
        Franz now listened to it for the third time; yet its notes, so tenderly
        expressive and fearfully grand as the wretched husband and wife give vent
        to their different griefs and passions, thrilled through the soul of Franz
        with an effect equal to his first emotions upon hearing it. Excited beyond
        his usual calm demeanor, Franz rose with the audience, and was about to
        join the loud, enthusiastic applause that followed; but suddenly his
        purpose was arrested, his hands fell by his sides, and the half-uttered
        &ldquo;bravos&rdquo; expired on his lips.
      </p>
      <p>
        The occupant of the box in which the Greek girl sat appeared to share the
        universal admiration that prevailed; for he left his seat to stand up in
        front, so that, his countenance being fully revealed, Franz had no
        difficulty in recognizing him as the mysterious inhabitant of Monte
        Cristo, and the very same person he had encountered the preceding evening
        in the ruins of the Colosseum, and whose voice and figure had seemed so
        familiar to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        All doubt of his identity was now at an end; his singular host evidently
        resided at Rome. The surprise and agitation occasioned by this full
        confirmation of Franz&rsquo;s former suspicion had no doubt imparted a
        corresponding expression to his features; for the countess, after gazing
        with a puzzled look at his face, burst into a fit of laughter, and begged
        to know what had happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Countess,&rdquo; returned Franz, totally unheeding her raillery,
        &ldquo;I asked you a short time since if you knew any particulars
        respecting the Albanian lady opposite; I must now beseech you to inform me
        who and what is her husband?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; answered the countess, &ldquo;I know no more of him
        than yourself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps you never before noticed him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What a question&mdash;so truly French! Do you not know that we
        Italians have eyes only for the man we love?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;True,&rdquo; replied Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;All I can say is,&rdquo; continued the countess, taking up the <i>lorgnette</i>,
        and directing it toward the box in question, &ldquo;that the gentleman,
        whose history I am unable to furnish, seems to me as though he had just
        been dug up; he looks more like a corpse permitted by some friendly
        grave-digger to quit his tomb for a while, and revisit this earth of ours,
        than anything human. How ghastly pale he is!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, he is always as colorless as you now see him,&rdquo; said
        Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you know him?&rdquo; almost screamed the countess. &ldquo;Oh,
        pray do, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, tell us all about&mdash;is he a vampire,
        or a resuscitated corpse, or what?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I fancy I have seen him before; and I even think he recognizes me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And I can well understand,&rdquo; said the countess, shrugging up
        her beautiful shoulders, as though an involuntary shudder passed through
        her veins, &ldquo;that those who have once seen that man will never be
        likely to forget him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The sensation experienced by Franz was evidently not peculiar to himself;
        another, and wholly uninterested person, felt the same unaccountable awe
        and misgiving.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well.&rdquo; inquired Franz, after the countess had a second time
        directed her <i>lorgnette</i> at the box, &ldquo;what do you think of our
        opposite neighbor?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20147m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, that he is no other than Lord Ruthven himself in a living
        form.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        This fresh allusion to
        Byron<a href="#linknote-5" name="linknoteref-5" id="linknoteref-5">5</a> drew
        a smile to Franz&rsquo;s countenance; although he could but allow that if
        anything was likely to induce belief in the existence of vampires, it would
        be the presence of such a man as the mysterious personage before him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I must positively find out who and what he is,&rdquo; said Franz,
        rising from his seat.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried the countess; &ldquo;you must not leave me. I
        depend upon you to escort me home. Oh, indeed, I cannot permit you to go.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; whispered Franz, &ldquo;that you entertain
        any fear?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; answered the countess. &ldquo;Byron had
        the most perfect belief in the existence of vampires, and even assured me
        that he had seen them. The description he gave me perfectly corresponds
        with the features and character of the man before us. Oh, he is the exact
        personification of what I have been led to expect! The coal-black hair,
        large bright, glittering eyes, in which a wild, unearthly fire seems
        burning,&mdash;the same ghastly paleness. Then observe, too, that the
        woman with him is altogether unlike all others of her sex. She is a
        foreigner&mdash;a stranger. Nobody knows who she is, or where she comes
        from. No doubt she belongs to the same horrible race he does, and is, like
        himself, a dealer in magical arts. I entreat of you not to go near him&mdash;at
        least tonight; and if tomorrow your curiosity still continues as great,
        pursue your researches if you will; but tonight you neither can nor shall.
        For that purpose I mean to keep you all to myself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz protested he could not defer his pursuit till the following day, for
        many reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen to me,&rdquo; said the countess, &ldquo;and do not be so
        very headstrong. I am going home. I have a party at my house tonight, and
        therefore cannot possibly remain till the end of the opera. Now, I cannot
        for one instant believe you so devoid of gallantry as to refuse a lady
        your escort when she even condescends to ask you for it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        There was nothing else left for Franz to do but to take up his hat, open
        the door of the box, and offer the countess his arm. It was quite evident,
        by her manner, that her uneasiness was not feigned; and Franz himself
        could not resist a feeling of superstitious dread&mdash;so much the
        stronger in him, as it arose from a variety of corroborative
        recollections, while the terror of the countess sprang from an instinctive
        belief, originally created in her mind by the wild tales she had listened
        to till she believed them truths. Franz could even feel her arm tremble as
        he assisted her into the carriage. Upon arriving at her hotel, Franz
        perceived that she had deceived him when she spoke of expecting company;
        on the contrary, her own return before the appointed hour seemed greatly
        to astonish the servants.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Excuse my little subterfuge,&rdquo; said the countess, in reply to
        her companion&rsquo;s half-reproachful observation on the subject; &ldquo;but
        that horrid man had made me feel quite uncomfortable, and I longed to be
        alone, that I might compose my startled mind.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz essayed to smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;do not smile; it ill accords with the
        expression of your countenance, and I am sure it does not spring from your
        heart. However, promise me one thing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Promise me, I say.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will do anything you desire, except relinquish my determination
        of finding out who this man is. I have more reasons than you can imagine
        for desiring to know who he is, from whence he came, and whither he is
        going.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where he comes from I am ignorant; but I can readily tell you where
        he is going to, and that is down below, without the least doubt.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us only speak of the promise you wished me to make,&rdquo; said
        Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, you must give me your word to return immediately to
        your hotel, and make no attempt to follow this man tonight. There are
        certain affinities between the persons we quit and those we meet
        afterwards. For heaven&rsquo;s sake, do not serve as a conductor between
        that man and me. Pursue your chase after him tomorrow as eagerly as you
        please; but never bring him near me, if you would not see me die of
        terror. And now, good-night; go to your rooms, and try to sleep away all
        recollections of this evening. For my own part, I am quite sure I shall
        not be able to close my eyes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        So saying, the countess quitted Franz, leaving him unable to decide
        whether she were merely amusing herself at his expense, or whether her
        fears and agitations were genuine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Upon his return to the hotel, Franz found Albert in his dressing-gown and
        slippers, listlessly extended on a sofa, smoking a cigar.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear fellow!&rdquo; cried he, springing up, &ldquo;is it really you?
        Why, I did not expect to see you before tomorrow.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear Albert,&rdquo; replied Franz, &ldquo;I am glad of this
        opportunity to tell you, once and forever, that you entertain a most
        erroneous notion concerning Italian women. I should have thought the
        continual failures you have met with in all your own love affairs might
        have taught you better by this time.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Upon my soul, these women would puzzle the very Devil to read them
        aright. Why, here&mdash;they give you their hand&mdash;they press yours in
        return&mdash;they keep up a whispering conversation&mdash;permit you to
        accompany them home. Why, if a Parisian were to indulge in a quarter of
        these marks of flattering attention, her reputation would be gone forever.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And the very reason why the women of this fine country, &lsquo;where sounds
        the <i>si</i>,&rsquo; as Dante writes, put so little restraint on their words and
        actions, is because they live so much in public, and have really nothing to
        conceal. Besides, you must have perceived that the countess was really alarmed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At what? At the sight of that respectable gentleman sitting
        opposite to us in the same box with the lovely Greek girl? Now, for my
        part, I met them in the lobby after the conclusion of the piece; and hang
        me, if I can guess where you took your notions of the other world from. I
        can assure you that this hobgoblin of yours is a deuced fine-looking
        fellow&mdash;admirably dressed. Indeed, I feel quite sure, from the cut of
        his clothes, they are made by a first-rate Paris tailor&mdash;probably
        Blin or Humann. He was rather too pale, certainly; but then, you know,
        paleness is always looked upon as a strong proof of aristocratic descent
        and distinguished breeding.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz smiled; for he well remembered that Albert particularly prided himself on
        the entire absence of color in his own complexion.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, that tends to confirm my own ideas,&rdquo; said Franz,
        &ldquo;that the countess&rsquo;s suspicions were destitute alike of sense
        and reason. Did he speak in your hearing? and did you catch any of his
        words?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I did; but they were uttered in the Romaic dialect. I knew that
        from the mixture of Greek words. I don&rsquo;t know whether I ever told
        you that when I was at college I was rather&mdash;rather strong in Greek.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He spoke the Romaic language, did he?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; murmured Franz. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis he, past
        all doubt.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing, nothing. But tell me, what were you thinking about when I
        came in?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I was arranging a little surprise for you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed. Of what nature?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, you know it is quite impossible to procure a carriage.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly; and I also know that we have done all that human means
        afforded to endeavor to get one.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now, then, in this difficulty a bright idea has flashed across my
        brain.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz looked at Albert as though he had not much confidence in the suggestions
        of his imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I tell you what, M. Franz,&rdquo; cried Albert, &ldquo;you deserve to be
        called out for such a misgiving and incredulous glance as that you were pleased
        to bestow on me just now.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And I promise to give you the satisfaction of a gentleman if your
        scheme turns out as ingenious as you assert.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, hearken to me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I listen.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You agree, do you not, that obtaining a carriage is out of the
        question?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Neither can we procure horses?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;True; we have offered any sum, but have failed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, now, what do you say to a cart? I dare say such a thing might
        be had.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very possibly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And a pair of oxen?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As easily found as the cart.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you see, my good fellow, with a cart and a couple of oxen our
        business can be managed. The cart must be tastefully ornamented; and if
        you and I dress ourselves as Neapolitan reapers, we may get up a striking
        tableau, after the manner of that splendid picture by Léopold Robert. It
        would add greatly to the effect if the countess would join us in the
        costume of a peasant from Puzzoli or Sorrento. Our group would then be
        quite complete, more especially as the countess is quite beautiful enough
        to represent a Madonna.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Franz, &ldquo;this time, M. Albert, I am bound to
        give you credit for having hit upon a most capital idea.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And quite a national one, too,&rdquo; replied Albert with gratified
        pride. &ldquo;A mere masque borrowed from our own festivities. Ha, ha, ye
        Romans! you thought to make us, unhappy strangers, trot at the heels of
        your processions, like so many lazzaroni, because no carriages or horses
        are to be had in your beggarly city. But you don&rsquo;t know us; when we
        can&rsquo;t have one thing we invent another.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And have you communicated your triumphant idea to anybody?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Only to our host. Upon my return home I sent for him, and I then
        explained to him what I wished to procure. He assured me that nothing
        would be easier than to furnish all I desired. One thing I was sorry for;
        when I bade him have the horns of the oxen gilded, he told me there would
        not be time, as it would require three days to do that; so you see we must
        do without this little superfluity.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And where is he now?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Who?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Our host.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Gone out in search of our equipage, by tomorrow it might be too
        late.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then he will be able to give us an answer tonight.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I expect him every minute.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At this instant the door opened, and the head of Signor Pastrini appeared.
        &ldquo;<i>Permesso</i>?&rdquo; inquired he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly&mdash;certainly,&rdquo; cried Franz. &ldquo;Come in, my
        host.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; asked Albert eagerly, &ldquo;have you found the
        desired cart and oxen?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Better than that!&rdquo; replied Signor Pastrini, with the air of a
        man perfectly well satisfied with himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Take care, my worthy host,&rdquo; said Albert, &ldquo;<i>better</i>
        is a sure enemy to <i>well</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let your excellencies only leave the matter to me,&rdquo; returned
        Signor Pastrini in a tone indicative of unbounded self-confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But what <i>have</i> you done?&rdquo; asked Franz. &ldquo;Speak
        out, there&rsquo;s a worthy fellow.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your excellencies are aware,&rdquo; responded the landlord,
        swelling with importance, &ldquo;that the Count of Monte Cristo is living
        on the same floor with yourselves!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I should think we did know it,&rdquo; exclaimed Albert, &ldquo;since
        it is owing to that circumstance that we are packed into these small
        rooms, like two poor students in the back streets of Paris.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;When, then, the Count of Monte Cristo, hearing of the dilemma in
        which you are placed, has sent to offer you seats in his carriage and two
        places at his windows in the Palazzo Rospoli.&rdquo; The friends looked at
        each other with unutterable surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But do you think,&rdquo; asked Albert, &ldquo;that we ought to
        accept such offers from a perfect stranger?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What sort of person is this Count of Monte Cristo?&rdquo; asked
        Franz of his host.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A very great nobleman, but whether Maltese or Sicilian I cannot
        exactly say; but this I know, that he is noble as a Borghese and rich as a
        gold mine.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Franz, speaking in an undertone to
        Albert, &ldquo;that if this person merited the high panegyrics of our
        landlord, he would have conveyed his invitation through another channel,
        and not permitted it to be brought to us in this unceremonious way. He
        would have written&mdash;or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At this instant someone knocked at the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        A servant, wearing a livery of considerable style and richness, appeared
        at the threshold, and, placing two cards in the landlord&rsquo;s hands,
        who forthwith presented them to the two young men, he said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Please to deliver these, from the Count of Monte Cristo to Vicomte Albert
        de Morcerf and M. Franz d&rsquo;Épinay. The Count of Monte Cristo,&rdquo;
        continued the servant, &ldquo;begs these gentlemen&rsquo;s permission to
        wait upon them as their neighbor, and he will be honored by an intimation
        of what time they will please to receive him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Faith, Franz,&rdquo; whispered Albert, &ldquo;there is not much to
        find fault with here.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Tell the count,&rdquo; replied Franz, &ldquo;that we will do
        ourselves the pleasure of calling on him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The servant bowed and retired.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is what I call an elegant mode of attack,&rdquo; said Albert,
        &ldquo;You were quite correct in what you said, Signor Pastrini. The Count
        of Monte Cristo is unquestionably a man of first-rate breeding and
        knowledge of the world.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you accept his offer?&rdquo; said the host.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course we do,&rdquo; replied Albert. &ldquo;Still, I must own I
        am sorry to be obliged to give up the cart and the group of reapers&mdash;it
        would have produced such an effect! And were it not for the windows at the
        Palazzo Rospoli, by way of recompense for the loss of our beautiful
        scheme, I don&rsquo;t know but what I should have held on by my original
        plan. What say you, Franz?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I agree with you; the windows in the Palazzo Rospoli alone
        decided me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The truth was, that the mention of two places in the Palazzo Rospoli had recalled
        to Franz the conversation he had overheard the preceding evening in the ruins of
        the Colosseum between the mysterious unknown and the Transteverin, in which the
        stranger in the cloak had undertaken to obtain the freedom of a condemned criminal;
        and if this muffled-up individual proved (as Franz felt sure he would) the same as
        the person he had just seen in the Teatro Argentina, then he should be able to
        establish his identity, and also to prosecute his researches respecting
        him with perfect facility and freedom.
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz passed the night in confused dreams respecting the two meetings he had
        already had with his mysterious tormentor, and in waking speculations as to what
        the morrow would produce. The next day must clear up every doubt; and unless his
        near neighbor and would-be friend, the Count of Monte Cristo, possessed the ring
        of Gyges, and by its power was able to render himself invisible, it was very
        certain he could not escape this time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eight o&rsquo;clock found Franz up and dressed, while Albert, who had not the same
        motives for early rising, was still soundly asleep. The first act of Franz was to
        summon his landlord, who presented himself with his accustomed obsequiousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Pray, Signor Pastrini,&rdquo; asked Franz, &ldquo;is not some
        execution appointed to take place today?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, your excellency; but if your reason for inquiry is that you
        may procure a window to view it from, you are much too late.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; answered Franz, &ldquo;I had no such intention; and
        even if I had felt a wish to witness the spectacle, I might have done so
        from Monte Pincio; could I not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed mine host, &ldquo;I did not think it likely
        your excellency would have chosen to mingle with such a rabble as are
        always collected on that hill, which, indeed, they consider as exclusively
        belonging to themselves.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very possibly I may not go,&rdquo; answered Franz; &ldquo;but in
        case I feel disposed, give me some particulars of today&rsquo;s
        executions.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What particulars would your excellency like to hear?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, the number of persons condemned to suffer, their names, and
        description of the death they are to die.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That happens just lucky, your excellency! Only a few minutes ago
        they brought me the <i>tavolettas</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What are they?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sort of wooden tablets hung up at the corners of streets the
        evening before an execution, on which is pasted up a paper containing the
        names of the condemned persons, their crimes, and mode of punishment. The
        reason for so publicly announcing all this is, that all good and faithful
        Catholics may offer up their prayers for the unfortunate culprits, and,
        above all, beseech of Heaven to grant them a sincere repentance.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And these tablets are brought to you that you may add your prayers
        to those of the faithful, are they?&rdquo; asked Franz somewhat
        incredulously.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, dear, no, your excellency! I have not time for anybody&rsquo;s
        affairs but my own and those of my honorable guests; but I make an
        agreement with the man who pastes up the papers, and he brings them to me
        as he would the playbills, that in case any person staying at my hotel
        should like to witness an execution, he may obtain every requisite
        information concerning the time and place etc.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Upon my word, that is a most delicate attention on your part,
        Signor Pastrini,&rdquo; cried Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, your excellency,&rdquo; returned the landlord, chuckling and
        rubbing his hands with infinite complacency, &ldquo;I think I may take
        upon myself to say I neglect nothing to deserve the support and patronage
        of the noble visitors to this poor hotel.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I see that plainly enough, my most excellent host, and you may rely
        upon me to proclaim so striking a proof of your attention to your guests
        wherever I go. Meanwhile, oblige me by a sight of one of these <i>tavolettas</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing can be easier than to comply with your excellency&rsquo;s
        wish,&rdquo; said the landlord, opening the door of the chamber; &ldquo;I
        have caused one to be placed on the landing, close by your apartment.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, taking the tablet from the wall, he handed it to Franz, who read as
        follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;The public is informed that on Wednesday, February 23rd,
        being the first day of the Carnival, executions will take place in the
        Piazza del Popolo, by order of the Tribunal of the Rota, of two persons,
        named Andrea Rondolo, and Peppino, otherwise called Rocca Priori; the
        former found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest,
        named Don César Torlini, canon of the church of St. John Lateran; and the
        latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary
        bandit, Luigi Vampa, and his band. The first-named malefactor will
        be <i>mazzolato</i>, the second culprit <i>decapitato</i>.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;The prayers of all good Christians are entreated for these
        unfortunate men, that it may please God to awaken them to a sense of their guilt,
        and to grant them a hearty and sincere repentance for their crimes.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        This was precisely what Franz had heard the evening before in the ruins of
        the Colosseum. No part of the programme differed,&mdash;the names of the
        condemned persons, their crimes, and mode of punishment, all agreed with
        his previous information. In all probability, therefore, the Transteverin
        was no other than the bandit Luigi Vampa himself, and the man shrouded in
        the mantle the same he had known as &ldquo;Sinbad the Sailor,&rdquo; but
        who, no doubt, was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition in Rome, as
        he had already done at Porto-Vecchio and Tunis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Time was getting on, however, and Franz deemed it advisable to awaken Albert; but
        at the moment he prepared to proceed to his chamber, his friend entered the room
        in perfect costume for the day. The anticipated delights of the Carnival had
        so run in his head as to make him leave his pillow long before his usual hour.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now, my excellent Signor Pastrini,&rdquo; said Franz, addressing
        his landlord, &ldquo;since we are both ready, do you think we may proceed
        at once to visit the Count of Monte Cristo?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Most assuredly,&rdquo; replied he. &ldquo;The Count of Monte Cristo
        is always an early riser; and I can answer for his having been up these
        two hours.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you really consider we shall not be intruding if we pay our
        respects to him directly?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20155m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I am quite sure. I will take all the blame on myself if you
        find I have led you into an error.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, if it be so, are you ready, Albert?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Perfectly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us go and return our best thanks for his courtesy.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, let us do so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The landlord preceded the friends across the landing, which was all that separated
        them from the apartments of the count, rang at the bell, and, upon the door being
        opened by a servant, said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>I signori Francesi</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The domestic bowed respectfully, and invited them to enter. They passed
        through two rooms, furnished in a luxurious manner they had not expected
        to see under the roof of Signor Pastrini, and were shown into an elegantly
        fitted-up drawing-room. The richest Turkey carpets covered the floor, and
        the softest and most inviting couches, easy-chairs, and sofas, offered
        their high-piled and yielding cushions to such as desired repose or
        refreshment. Splendid paintings by the first masters were ranged against
        the walls, intermingled with magnificent trophies of war, while heavy
        curtains of costly tapestry were suspended before the different doors of the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If your excellencies will please to be seated,&rdquo; said the
        man, &ldquo;I will let the count know that you are here.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And with these words he disappeared behind one of the tapestried <i>portières</i>.
        As the door opened, the sound of a <i>guzla</i> reached the ears of the
        young men, but was almost immediately lost, for the rapid closing of the
        door merely allowed one rich swell of harmony to enter. Franz and Albert
        looked inquiringly at each other, then at the gorgeous furnishings of the
        apartment. Everything seemed more magnificent at a second view than it had
        done at their first rapid survey.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Franz to his friend, &ldquo;what think you of all
        this?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, upon my soul, my dear fellow, it strikes me that our elegant
        and attentive neighbor must either be some successful stock-jobber who has
        speculated in the fall of the Spanish funds, or some prince travelling <i>incog</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Hush, hush!&rdquo; replied Franz; &ldquo;we shall ascertain who and
        what he is&mdash;he comes!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        As Franz spoke, he heard the sound of a door turning on its hinges, and almost
        immediately afterwards the tapestry was drawn aside, and the owner of all these
        riches stood before the two young men. Albert instantly rose to meet him, but Franz
        remained, in a manner, spellbound on his chair; for in the person of him who had
        just entered he recognized not only the mysterious visitant to the Colosseum,
        and the occupant of the box at the Teatro Argentina, but also his
        extraordinary host of Monte Cristo.
