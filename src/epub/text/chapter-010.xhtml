      <h2>Chapter 10. The King&rsquo;s Closet at the Tuileries</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>e will leave
        Villefort on the road to Paris, travelling&mdash;thanks to trebled fees&mdash;with
        all speed, and passing through two or three apartments, enter at the
        Tuileries the little room with the arched window, so well known as having
        been the favorite closet of Napoleon and Louis XVIII., and now of Louis
        Philippe.
      </p>
      <p>
        There, seated before a walnut table he had brought with him from Hartwell,
        and to which, from one of those fancies not uncommon to great people, he
        was particularly attached, the king, Louis XVIII., was carelessly
        listening to a man of fifty or fifty-two years of age, with gray hair,
        aristocratic bearing, and exceedingly gentlemanly attire, and meanwhile
        making a marginal note in a volume of Gryphius&rsquo;s rather inaccurate,
        but much sought-after, edition of Horace&mdash;a work which was much
        indebted to the sagacious observations of the philosophical monarch.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You say, sir&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; said the king.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That I am exceedingly disquieted, sire.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Really, have you had a vision of the seven fat kine and the seven
        lean kine?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, sire, for that would only betoken for us seven years of plenty
        and seven years of scarcity; and with a king as full of foresight as your
        majesty, scarcity is not a thing to be feared.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then of what other scourge are you afraid, my dear Blacas?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sire, I have every reason to believe that a storm is brewing in the
        south.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, my dear duke,&rdquo; replied Louis XVIII., &ldquo;I think you
        are wrongly informed, and know positively that, on the contrary, it is
        very fine weather in that direction.&rdquo; Man of ability as he was,
        Louis XVIII. liked a pleasant jest.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; continued M. de Blacas, &ldquo;if it only be to
        reassure a faithful servant, will your majesty send into Languedoc,
        Provence, and Dauphiné, trusty men, who will bring you back a faithful
        report as to the feeling in these three provinces?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Canimus surdis</i>,&rdquo; replied the king, continuing the
        annotations in his Horace.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied the courtier, laughing, in order that he might
        seem to comprehend the quotation, &ldquo;your majesty may be perfectly
        right in relying on the good feeling of France, but I fear I am not
        altogether wrong in dreading some desperate attempt.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By whom?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By Bonaparte, or, at least, by his adherents.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear Blacas,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;you with your alarms
        prevent me from working.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you, sire, prevent me from sleeping with your security.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Wait, my dear sir, wait a moment; for I have such a delightful note
        on the <i>Pastor quum traheret</i>&mdash;wait, and I will listen to you
        afterwards.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a brief pause, during which Louis XVIII. wrote, in a hand as
        small as possible, another note on the margin of his Horace, and then
        looking at the duke with the air of a man who thinks he has an idea of his
        own, while he is only commenting upon the idea of another, said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Go on, my dear duke, go on&mdash;I listen.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said Blacas, who had for a moment the hope of
        sacrificing Villefort to his own profit, &ldquo;I am compelled to tell you
        that these are not mere rumors destitute of foundation which thus disquiet
        me; but a serious-minded man, deserving all my confidence, and charged by
        me to watch over the south&rdquo; (the duke hesitated as he pronounced
        these words), &ldquo;has arrived by post to tell me that a great peril
        threatens the king, and so I hastened to you, sire.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Mala ducis avi domum</i>,&rdquo; continued Louis XVIII., still
        annotating.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Does your majesty wish me to drop the subject?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By no means, my dear duke; but just stretch out your hand.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Which?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Whichever you please&mdash;there to the left.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Here, sire?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I tell you to the left, and you are looking to the right; I mean on
        my left&mdash;yes, there. You will find yesterday&rsquo;s report of the
        minister of police. But here is M. Dandré himself;&rdquo; and M. Dandré,
        announced by the chamberlain-in-waiting, entered.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said Louis XVIII., with repressed smile, &ldquo;come
        in, Baron, and tell the duke all you know&mdash;the latest news of M. de
        Bonaparte; do not conceal anything, however serious,&mdash;let us see, the
        Island of Elba is a volcano, and we may expect to have issuing thence
        flaming and bristling war&mdash;<i>bella, horrida bella</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        M. Dandré leaned very respectfully on the back of a chair with his two hands,
        and said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Has your majesty perused yesterday&rsquo;s report?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes; but tell the duke himself, who cannot find anything, what
        the report contains&mdash;give him the particulars of what the usurper is
        doing in his islet.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the baron to the duke, &ldquo;all the
        servants of his majesty must approve of the latest intelligence which we
        have from the Island of Elba. Bonaparte&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        M. Dandré looked at Louis XVIII., who, employed in writing a note, did not
        even raise his head. &ldquo;Bonaparte,&rdquo; continued the baron, &ldquo;is
        mortally wearied, and passes whole days in watching his miners at work at
        Porto-Longone.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And scratches himself for amusement,&rdquo; added the king.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Scratches himself?&rdquo; inquired the duke, &ldquo;what does your
        majesty mean?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, indeed, my dear duke. Did you forget that this great man, this
        hero, this demigod, is attacked with a malady of the skin which worries
        him to death, <i>prurigo</i>?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And, moreover, my dear duke,&rdquo; continued the minister of
        police, &ldquo;we are almost assured that, in a very short time, the
        usurper will be insane.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Insane?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Raving mad; his head becomes weaker. Sometimes he weeps bitterly,
        sometimes laughs boisterously, at other time he passes hours on the
        seashore, flinging stones in the water and when the flint makes &lsquo;duck-and-drake&rsquo;
        five or six times, he appears as delighted as if he had gained another
        Marengo or Austerlitz. Now, you must agree that these are indubitable
        symptoms of insanity.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Or of wisdom, my dear baron&mdash;or of wisdom,&rdquo; said Louis
        XVIII., laughing; &ldquo;the greatest captains of antiquity amused
        themselves by casting pebbles into the ocean&mdash;see Plutarch&rsquo;s
        life of Scipio Africanus.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        M. de Blacas pondered deeply between the confident monarch and the
        truthful minister. Villefort, who did not choose to reveal the whole
        secret, lest another should reap all the benefit of the disclosure, had
        yet communicated enough to cause him the greatest uneasiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, well, Dandré,&rdquo; said Louis XVIII., &ldquo;Blacas is not
        yet convinced; let us proceed, therefore, to the usurper&rsquo;s
        conversion.&rdquo; The minister of police bowed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The usurper&rsquo;s conversion!&rdquo; murmured the duke, looking
        at the king and Dandré, who spoke alternately, like Virgil&rsquo;s
        shepherds. &ldquo;The usurper converted!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Decidedly, my dear duke.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In what way converted?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To good principles. Tell him all about it, baron.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, this is the way of it,&rdquo; said the minister, with the
        gravest air in the world: &ldquo;Napoleon lately had a review, and as two
        or three of his old veterans expressed a desire to return to France, he
        gave them their dismissal, and exhorted them to &lsquo;serve the good
        king.&rsquo; These were his own words, of that I am certain.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, Blacas, what think you of this?&rdquo; inquired the king
        triumphantly, and pausing for a moment from the voluminous scholiast
        before him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I say, sire, that the minister of police is greatly deceived or I
        am; and as it is impossible it can be the minister of police as he has the
        guardianship of the safety and honor of your majesty, it is probable that
        I am in error. However, sire, if I might advise, your majesty will
        interrogate the person of whom I spoke to you, and I will urge your
        majesty to do him this honor.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Most willingly, duke; under your auspices I will receive any person
        you please, but you must not expect me to be too confiding. Baron, have
        you any report more recent than this, dated the 20th February, and this
        is the 3rd of March?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, sire, but I am hourly expecting one; it may have arrived since
        I left my office.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Go thither, and if there be none&mdash;well, well,&rdquo; continued
        Louis XVIII., &ldquo;make one; that is the usual way, is it not?&rdquo;
        and the king laughed facetiously.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, sire,&rdquo; replied the minister, &ldquo;we have no occasion
        to invent any; every day our desks are loaded with most circumstantial
        denunciations, coming from hosts of people who hope for some return for
        services which they seek to render, but cannot; they trust to fortune, and
        rely upon some unexpected event in some way to justify their predictions.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, sir, go&rdquo;; said Louis XVIII., &ldquo;and remember that I
        am waiting for you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will but go and return, sire; I shall be back in ten minutes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And I, sire,&rdquo; said M. de Blacas, &ldquo;will go and find my
        messenger.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Wait, sir, wait,&rdquo; said Louis XVIII. &ldquo;Really, M. de
        Blacas, I must change your armorial bearings; I will give you an eagle
        with outstretched wings, holding in its claws a prey which tries in vain
        to escape, and bearing this device&mdash;<i>Tenax</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0133m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sire, I listen,&rdquo; said De Blacas, biting his nails with
        impatience.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I wish to consult you on this passage, &lsquo;<i>Molli fugiens
        anhelitu</i>,&rsquo; you know it refers to a stag flying from a wolf. Are
        you not a sportsman and a great wolf-hunter? Well, then, what do you think
        of the <i>molli anhelitu</i>?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Admirable, sire; but my messenger is like the stag you refer to,
        for he has posted two hundred and twenty leagues in scarcely three days.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Which is undergoing great fatigue and anxiety, my dear duke, when
        we have a telegraph which transmits messages in three or four hours, and
        that without getting in the least out of breath.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, sire, you recompense but badly this poor young man, who has
        come so far, and with so much ardor, to give your majesty useful
        information. If only for the sake of M. de Salvieux, who recommends him to
        me, I entreat your majesty to receive him graciously.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. de Salvieux, my brother&rsquo;s chamberlain?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is at Marseilles.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And writes me thence.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Does he speak to you of this conspiracy?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; but strongly recommends M. de Villefort, and begs me to present
        him to your majesty.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. de Villefort!&rdquo; cried the king, &ldquo;is the messenger&rsquo;s
        name M. de Villefort?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, sire.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And he comes from Marseilles?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In person.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why did you not mention his name at once?&rdquo; replied the king,
        betraying some uneasiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sire, I thought his name was unknown to your majesty.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, no, Blacas; he is a man of strong and elevated understanding,
        ambitious, too, and, <i>pardieu!</i> you know his father&rsquo;s name!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;His father?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, Noirtier.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Noirtier the Girondin?&mdash;Noirtier the senator?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He himself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And your majesty has employed the son of such a man?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Blacas, my friend, you have but limited comprehension. I told you
        Villefort was ambitious, and to attain this ambition Villefort would
        sacrifice everything, even his father.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then, sire, may I present him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This instant, duke! Where is he?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Waiting below, in my carriage.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Seek him at once.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I hasten to do so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The duke left the royal presence with the speed of a young man; his really
        sincere royalism made him youthful again. Louis XVIII. remained alone, and
        turning his eyes on his half-opened Horace, muttered:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Justum et tenacem propositi virum</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        M. de Blacas returned as speedily as he had departed, but in the
        antechamber he was forced to appeal to the king&rsquo;s authority.
        Villefort&rsquo;s dusty garb, his costume, which was not of courtly cut,
        excited the susceptibility of M. de Brezé, who was all astonishment at
        finding that this young man had the audacity to enter before the king in
        such attire. The duke, however, overcame all difficulties with a word&mdash;his
        majesty&rsquo;s order; and, in spite of the protestations which the master
        of ceremonies made for the honor of his office and principles, Villefort
        was introduced.
      </p>
      <p>
        The king was seated in the same place where the duke had left him. On
        opening the door, Villefort found himself facing him, and the young
        magistrate&rsquo;s first impulse was to pause.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come in, M. de Villefort,&rdquo; said the king, &ldquo;come in.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort bowed, and advancing a few steps, waited until the king should
        interrogate him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. de Villefort,&rdquo; said Louis XVIII., &ldquo;the Duc de Blacas
        assures me you have some interesting information to communicate.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sire, the duke is right, and I believe your majesty will think it
        equally important.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0137m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In the first place, and before everything else, sir, is the news as
        bad in your opinion as I am asked to believe?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sire, I believe it to be most urgent, but I hope, by the speed I
        have used, that it is not irreparable.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Speak as fully as you please, sir,&rdquo; said the king, who began
        to give way to the emotion which had showed itself in Blacas&rsquo;s face
        and affected Villefort&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;Speak, sir, and pray begin at
        the beginning; I like order in everything.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said Villefort, &ldquo;I will render a faithful report
        to your majesty, but I must entreat your forgiveness if my anxiety leads
        to some obscurity in my language.&rdquo; A glance at the king after this
        discreet and subtle exordium, assured Villefort of the benignity of his
        august auditor, and he went on:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sire, I have come as rapidly to Paris as possible, to inform your
        majesty that I have discovered, in the exercise of my duties, not a
        commonplace and insignificant plot, such as is every day got up in the
        lower ranks of the people and in the army, but an actual conspiracy&mdash;a
        storm which menaces no less than your majesty&rsquo;s throne. Sire, the
        usurper is arming three ships, he meditates some project, which, however
        mad, is yet, perhaps, terrible. At this moment he will have left Elba, to
        go whither I know not, but assuredly to attempt a landing either at
        Naples, or on the coast of Tuscany, or perhaps on the shores of France.
        Your majesty is well aware that the sovereign of the Island of Elba has
        maintained his relations with Italy and France?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am, sir,&rdquo; said the king, much agitated; &ldquo;and recently
        we have had information that the Bonapartist clubs have had meetings in
        the Rue Saint-Jacques. But proceed, I beg of you. How did you obtain these
        details?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sire, they are the results of an examination which I have made of a
        man of Marseilles, whom I have watched for some time, and arrested on the
        day of my departure. This person, a sailor, of turbulent character, and
        whom I suspected of Bonapartism, has been secretly to the Island of Elba.
        There he saw the grand-marshal, who charged him with an oral message to a
        Bonapartist in Paris, whose name I could not extract from him; but this
        mission was to prepare men&rsquo;s minds for a return (it is the man who
        says this, sire)&mdash;a return which will soon occur.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And where is this man?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In prison, sire.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And the matter seems serious to you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So serious, sire, that when the circumstance surprised me in the
        midst of a family festival, on the very day of my betrothal, I left my
        bride and friends, postponing everything, that I might hasten to lay at
        your majesty&rsquo;s feet the fears which impressed me, and the assurance
        of my devotion.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;True,&rdquo; said Louis XVIII., &ldquo;was there not a marriage
        engagement between you and Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Daughter of one of your majesty&rsquo;s most faithful servants.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes; but let us talk of this plot, M. de Villefort.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sire, I fear it is more than a plot; I fear it is a conspiracy.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A conspiracy in these times,&rdquo; said Louis XVIII., smiling,
        &ldquo;is a thing very easy to meditate, but more difficult to conduct to
        an end, inasmuch as, re-established so recently on the throne of our
        ancestors, we have our eyes open at once upon the past, the present, and
        the future. For the last ten months my ministers have redoubled their
        vigilance, in order to watch the shore of the Mediterranean. If Bonaparte
        landed at Naples, the whole coalition would be on foot before he could
        even reach Piombino; if he land in Tuscany, he will be in an unfriendly
        territory; if he land in France, it must be with a handful of men, and the
        result of that is easily foretold, execrated as he is by the population.
        Take courage, sir; but at the same time rely on our royal gratitude.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, here is M. Dandré!&rdquo; cried de Blacas. At this instant the
        minister of police appeared at the door, pale, trembling, and as if ready
        to faint. Villefort was about to retire, but M. de Blacas, taking his
        hand, restrained him.
