      <h2>Chapter 47. The Dappled Grays</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he baron, followed
        by the count, traversed a long series of apartments, in which the
        prevailing characteristics were heavy magnificence and the gaudiness of
        ostentatious wealth, until he reached the boudoir of Madame Danglars&mdash;a
        small octagonal-shaped room, hung with pink satin, covered with white
        Indian muslin. The chairs were of ancient workmanship and materials; over
        the doors were painted sketches of shepherds and shepherdesses, after the
        style and manner of Boucher; and at each side pretty medallions in
        crayons, harmonizing well with the furnishings of this charming apartment,
        the only one throughout the great mansion in which any distinctive taste
        prevailed. The truth was, it had been entirely overlooked in the plan
        arranged and followed out by M. Danglars and his architect, who had been
        selected to aid the baron in the great work of improvement solely because
        he was the most fashionable and celebrated decorator of the day. The
        decorations of the boudoir had then been left entirely to Madame Danglars
        and Lucien Debray. M. Danglars, however, while possessing a great
        admiration for the antique, as it was understood during the time of the
        Directory, entertained the most sovereign contempt for the simple elegance
        of his wife&rsquo;s favorite sitting-room, where, by the way, he was never
        permitted to intrude, unless, indeed, he excused his own appearance by
        ushering in some more agreeable visitor than himself; and even then he had
        rather the air and manner of a person who was himself introduced, than
        that of being the presenter of another, his reception being cordial or
        frigid, in proportion as the person who accompanied him chanced to please
        or displease the baroness.
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Danglars (who, although past the first bloom of youth, was still
        strikingly handsome) was now seated at the piano, a most elaborate piece
        of cabinet and inlaid work, while Lucien Debray, standing before a small
        work-table, was turning over the pages of an album.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lucien had found time, preparatory to the count&rsquo;s arrival, to relate many
        particulars respecting him to Madame Danglars. It will be remembered that Monte
        Cristo had made a lively impression on the minds of all the party assembled at
        the breakfast given by Albert de Morcerf; and although Debray was not in
        the habit of yielding to such feelings, he had never been able to shake
        off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the impressive look and
        manner of the count, consequently the description given by Lucien to the
        baroness bore the highly-colored tinge of his own heated imagination.
        Already excited by the wonderful stories related of the count by de
        Morcerf, it is no wonder that Madame Danglars eagerly listened to, and
        fully credited, all the additional circumstances detailed by Debray. This
        posing at the piano and over the album was only a little ruse adopted by
        way of precaution. A most gracious welcome and unusual smile were bestowed
        on M. Danglars; the count, in return for his gentlemanly bow, received a
        formal though graceful courtesy, while Lucien exchanged with the count a
        sort of distant recognition, and with Danglars a free and easy nod.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Baroness,&rdquo; said Danglars, &ldquo;give me leave to present to
        you the Count of Monte Cristo, who has been most warmly recommended to me
        by my correspondents at Rome. I need but mention one fact to make all the
        ladies in Paris court his notice, and that is, that he has come to take up
        his abode in Paris for a year, during which brief period he proposes to
        spend six millions of money. That means balls, dinners, and lawn parties
        without end, in all of which I trust the count will remember us, as he may
        depend upon it we shall him, in our own humble entertainments.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        In spite of the gross flattery and coarseness of this address, Madame
        Danglars could not forbear gazing with considerable interest on a man
        capable of expending six millions in twelve months, and who had selected
        Paris for the scene of his princely extravagance.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And when did you arrive here?&rdquo; inquired she.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yesterday morning, madame.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Coming, as usual, I presume, from the extreme end of the globe?
        Pardon me&mdash;at least, such I have heard is your custom.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nay, madame. This time I have merely come from Cadiz.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have selected a most unfavorable moment for your first visit.
        Paris is a horrible place in summer. Balls, parties, and <i>fêtes</i> are
        over; the Italian opera is in London; the French opera everywhere except
        in Paris. As for the Théatre Français, you know, of course, that it is
        nowhere. The only amusements left us are the indifferent races at the
        Champ-de-Mars and Satory. Do you propose entering any horses at either of
        these races, count?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall do whatever they do at Paris, madame, if I have the good
        fortune to find someone who will initiate me into the prevalent ideas of
        amusement.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you fond of horses, count?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have passed a considerable part of my life in the East, madame,
        and you are doubtless aware that the Orientals value only two things&mdash;the
        fine breeding of their horses and the beauty of their women.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nay, count,&rdquo; said the baroness, &ldquo;it would have been
        somewhat more gallant to have placed the ladies first.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You see, madame, how rightly I spoke when I said I required a
        preceptor to guide me in all my sayings and doings here.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At this instant the favorite attendant of Madame Danglars entered the boudoir;
        approaching her mistress, she spoke some words in an undertone. Madame
        Danglars turned very pale, then exclaimed:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I cannot believe it; the thing is impossible.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I assure you, madame,&rdquo; replied the woman, &ldquo;it is as I
        have said.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Turning impatiently towards her husband, Madame Danglars demanded, &ldquo;Is
        this true?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is what true, madame?&rdquo; inquired Danglars, visibly agitated.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What my maid tells me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But what does she tell you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That when my coachman was about to harness the horses to my
        carriage, he discovered that they had been removed from the stables
        without his knowledge. I desire to know what is the meaning of this?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Be kind enough, madame, to listen to me,&rdquo; said Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes; I will listen, monsieur, for I am most curious to hear
        what explanation you will give. These two gentlemen shall decide between
        us; but, first, I will state the case to them. Gentlemen,&rdquo; continued
        the baroness, &ldquo;among the ten horses in the stables of Baron
        Danglars, are two that belong exclusively to me&mdash;a pair of the
        handsomest and most spirited creatures to be found in Paris. But to you,
        at least, M. Debray, I need not give a further description, because to you
        my beautiful pair of dappled grays were well known. Well, I had promised
        Madame de Villefort the loan of my carriage to drive tomorrow to the Bois;
        but when my coachman goes to fetch the grays from the stables they are
        gone&mdash;positively gone. No doubt M. Danglars has sacrificed them to
        the selfish consideration of gaining some thousands of paltry francs. Oh,
        what a detestable crew they are, these mercenary speculators!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; replied Danglars, &ldquo;the horses were not
        sufficiently quiet for you; they were scarcely four years old, and they
        made me extremely uneasy on your account.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; retorted the baroness; &ldquo;you could not have
        entertained any alarm on the subject, because you are perfectly well aware
        that I have had for a month in my service the very best coachman in Paris.
        But, perhaps, you have disposed of the coachman as well as the horses?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear love, pray do not say any more about them, and I promise
        you another pair exactly like them in appearance, only more quiet and
        steady.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The baroness shrugged her shoulders with an air of ineffable contempt, while her
        husband, affecting not to observe this unconjugal gesture, turned towards Monte
        Cristo and said,&mdash;&ldquo;Upon my word, count, I am quite sorry not to have
        met you sooner. You are setting up an establishment, of course?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; replied the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I should have liked to have made you the offer of these horses. I
        have almost given them away, as it is; but, as I before said, I was
        anxious to get rid of them upon any terms. They were only fit for a young
        man.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am much obliged by your kind intentions towards me,&rdquo; said
        Monte Cristo; &ldquo;but this morning I purchased a very excellent pair of
        carriage-horses, and I do not think they were dear. There they are. Come,
        M. Debray, you are a connoisseur, I believe, let me have your opinion upon
        them.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        As Debray walked towards the window, Danglars approached his wife.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I could not tell you before others,&rdquo; said he in a low tone, &ldquo;the
        reason of my parting with the horses; but a most enormous price was offered me
        this morning for them. Some madman or fool, bent upon ruining himself as fast as
        he can, actually sent his steward to me to purchase them at any cost; and the fact
        is, I have gained 16,000 francs by the sale of them. Come, don&rsquo;t look so
        angry, and you shall have 4,000 francs of the money to do what you like with, and
        Eugénie shall have 2,000. There, what do you think now of the affair? Wasn&rsquo;t
        I right to part with the horses?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame Danglars surveyed her husband with a look of withering contempt.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Great heavens?&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Debray.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked the baroness.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I cannot be mistaken; there are your horses! The very animals we
        were speaking of, harnessed to the count&rsquo;s carriage!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dappled grays?&rdquo; demanded the baroness, springing to the
        window. &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis indeed they!&rdquo; said she.
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars looked absolutely stupefied.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How very singular,&rdquo; cried Monte Cristo with well-feigned astonishment.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I cannot believe it,&rdquo; murmured the banker. Madame Danglars
        whispered a few words in the ear of Debray, who approached Monte Cristo,
        saying, &ldquo;The baroness wishes to know what you paid her husband for
        the horses.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I scarcely know,&rdquo; replied the count; &ldquo;it was a little
        surprise prepared for me by my steward, and cost me&mdash;well, somewhere
        about 30,000 francs.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Debray conveyed the count&rsquo;s reply to the baroness. Poor Danglars looked so
        crest-fallen and discomfited that Monte Cristo assumed a pitying air towards him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;See,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;how very ungrateful women are. Your kind
        attention, in providing for the safety of the baroness by disposing of the horses,
        does not seem to have made the least impression on her. But so it is; a woman
        will often, from mere wilfulness, prefer that which is dangerous to that
        which is safe. Therefore, in my opinion, my dear baron, the best and
        easiest way is to leave them to their fancies, and allow them to act as
        they please, and then, if any mischief follows, why, at least, they have
        no one to blame but themselves.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars made no reply; he was occupied in anticipations of the coming scene
        between himself and the baroness, whose frowning brow, like that of Olympic Jove,
        predicted a storm. Debray, who perceived the gathering clouds, and felt no desire
        to witness the explosion of Madame Danglars&rsquo; rage, suddenly recollected
        an appointment, which compelled him to take his leave; while Monte Cristo,
        unwilling by prolonging his stay to destroy the advantages he hoped to
        obtain, made a farewell bow and departed, leaving Danglars to endure the
        angry reproaches of his wife.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20347m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Excellent,&rdquo; murmured Monte Cristo to himself, as he came
        away. &ldquo;All has gone according to my wishes. The domestic peace of
        this family is henceforth in my hands. Now, then, to play another
        master-stroke, by which I shall gain the heart of both husband and wife&mdash;delightful!
        Still,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;amid all this, I have not yet been
        presented to Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars, whose acquaintance I should
        have been glad to make. But,&rdquo; he went on with his peculiar smile,
        &ldquo;I am here in Paris, and have plenty of time before me&mdash;by and
        by will do for that.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        With these reflections he entered his carriage and returned home. Two hours
        afterwards, Madame Danglars received a most flattering epistle from the count, in
        which he entreated her to receive back her favorite &ldquo;dappled grays,&rdquo;
        protesting that he could not endure the idea of making his entry into the Parisian
        world of fashion with the knowledge that his splendid equipage had been obtained
        at the price of a lovely woman&rsquo;s regrets. The horses were sent back wearing
        the same harness she had seen on them in the morning; only, by the count&rsquo;s
        orders, in the centre of each rosette that adorned either side of their
        heads, had been fastened a large diamond.
      </p>
      <p>
        To Danglars Monte Cristo also wrote, requesting him to excuse the
        whimsical gift of a capricious millionaire, and to beg the baroness to
        pardon the Eastern fashion adopted in the return of the horses.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the evening, Monte Cristo quitted Paris for Auteuil, accompanied by
        Ali. The following day, about three o&rsquo;clock, a single blow struck on
        the gong summoned Ali to the presence of the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ali,&rdquo; observed his master, as the Nubian entered the chamber,
        &ldquo;you have frequently explained to me how more than commonly skilful you are
        in throwing the lasso, have you not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Ali drew himself up proudly, and then returned a sign in the affirmative.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I thought I did not mistake. With your lasso you could stop an ox?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Again Ali repeated his affirmative gesture.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Or a tiger?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Ali bowed his head in token of assent.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A lion even?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Ali sprung forwards, imitating the action of one throwing the lasso, then of a
        strangled lion.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo; &ldquo;you wish to tell me
        you have hunted the lion?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Ali smiled with triumphant pride as he signified that he had indeed both chased
        and captured many lions.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But do you believe you could arrest the progress of two horses rushing
        forwards with ungovernable fury?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The Nubian smiled.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo. &ldquo;Then listen to me. Ere long
        a carriage will dash past here, drawn by the pair of dappled gray horses you
        saw me with yesterday; now, at the risk of your own life, you must manage
        to stop those horses before my door.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Ali descended to the street, and marked a straight line on the pavement
        immediately at the entrance of the house, and then pointed out the line he
        had traced to the count, who was watching him. The count patted him gently
        on the shoulder, his usual mode of praising Ali, who, pleased and
        gratified with the commission assigned him, walked calmly towards a
        projecting stone forming the angle of the street and house, and, seating
        himself thereon, began to smoke his chibouque, while Monte Cristo
        re-entered his dwelling, perfectly assured of the success of his plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, as five o&rsquo;clock approached, and the carriage was momentarily
        expected by the count, the indication of more than common impatience and
        uneasiness might be observed in his manner. He stationed himself in a room
        commanding a view of the street, pacing the chamber with restless steps,
        stopping merely to listen from time to time for the sound of approaching
        wheels, then to cast an anxious glance on Ali; but the regularity with
        which the Nubian puffed forth the smoke of his chibouque proved that he at
        least was wholly absorbed in the enjoyment of his favorite occupation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suddenly a distant sound of rapidly advancing wheels was heard, and almost
        immediately a carriage appeared, drawn by a pair of wild, ungovernable
        horses, while the terrified coachman strove in vain to restrain their
        furious speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the vehicle was a young woman and a child of about seven or eight
        clasped in each other&rsquo;s arms. Terror seemed to have deprived them
        even of the power of uttering a cry. The carriage creaked and rattled as
        it flew over the rough stones, and the slightest obstacle under the wheels
        would have caused disaster; but it kept on in the middle of the road, and
        those who saw it pass uttered cries of terror.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ali suddenly cast aside his chibouque, drew the lasso from his pocket,
        threw it so skilfully as to catch the forelegs of the near horse in its
        triple fold, and suffered himself to be dragged on for a few steps by the
        violence of the shock, then the animal fell over on the pole, which
        snapped, and therefore prevented the other horse from pursuing its way.
        Gladly availing himself of this opportunity, the coachman leaped from his
        box; but Ali had promptly seized the nostrils of the second horse, and
        held them in his iron grasp, till the beast, snorting with pain, sunk
        beside his companion.
      </p>
      <p>
        All this was achieved in much less time than is occupied in the recital. The brief
        space had, however, been sufficient for a man, followed by a number of servants,
        to rush from the house before which the accident had occurred, and, as the coachman
        opened the door of the carriage, to take from it a lady who was convulsively
        grasping the cushions with one hand, while with the other she pressed to her
        bosom the young boy, who had lost consciousness. Monte Cristo carried them both
        to the salon, and deposited them on a sofa.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Compose yourself, madame,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;all danger is
        over.&rdquo; The woman looked up at these words, and, with a glance far
        more expressive than any entreaties could have been, pointed to her child,
        who still continued insensible. &ldquo;I understand the nature of your
        alarms, madame,&rdquo; said the count, carefully examining the child,
        &ldquo;but I assure you there is not the slightest occasion for
        uneasiness; your little charge has not received the least injury; his
        insensibility is merely the effects of terror, and will soon pass.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you quite sure you do not say so to tranquillize my fears? See
        how deadly pale he is! My child, my darling Edward; speak to your mother&mdash;open
        your dear eyes and look on me once again! Oh, sir, in pity send for a
        physician; my whole fortune shall not be thought too much for the recovery
        of my boy.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        With a calm smile and a gentle wave of the hand, Monte Cristo signed to
        the distracted mother to lay aside her apprehensions; then, opening a
        casket that stood near, he drew forth a phial of Bohemian glass incrusted
        with gold, containing a liquid of the color of blood, of which he let fall
        a single drop on the child&rsquo;s lips. Scarcely had it reached them, ere
        the boy, though still pale as marble, opened his eyes, and eagerly gazed
        around him. At this, the delight of the mother was almost frantic.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where am I?&rdquo; exclaimed she; &ldquo;and to whom am I indebted for
        so happy a termination to my late dreadful alarm?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Madame,&rdquo; answered the count, &ldquo;you are under the roof of
        one who esteems himself most fortunate in having been able to save you
        from a further continuance of your sufferings.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My wretched curiosity has brought all this about,&rdquo; pursued
        the lady. &ldquo;All Paris rung with the praises of Madame Danglars&rsquo;
        beautiful horses, and I had the folly to desire to know whether they
        really merited the high praise given to them.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is it possible,&rdquo; exclaimed the count with well-feigned
        astonishment, &ldquo;that these horses belong to the baroness?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They do, indeed. May I inquire if you are acquainted with Madame
        Danglars?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20351m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have that honor; and my happiness at your escape from the danger
        that threatened you is redoubled by the consciousness that I have been the
        unwilling and the unintentional cause of all the peril you have incurred.
        I yesterday purchased these horses of the baron; but as the baroness
        evidently regretted parting with them, I ventured to send them back to
        her, with a request that she would gratify me by accepting them from my
        hands.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are, then, doubtless, the Count of Monte Cristo, of whom
        Hermine has talked to me so much?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have rightly guessed, madame,&rdquo; replied the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And I am Madame Héloïse de Villefort.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The count bowed with the air of a person who hears a name for the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How grateful will M. de Villefort be for all your goodness; how thankfully
        will he acknowledge that to you alone he owes the existence of his wife
        and child! Most certainly, but for the prompt assistance of your intrepid
        servant, this dear child and myself must both have perished.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed, I still shudder at the fearful danger you were placed in.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I trust you will allow me to recompense worthily the devotion of
        your man.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I beseech you, madame,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo &ldquo;not to
        spoil Ali, either by too great praise or rewards. I cannot allow him to
        acquire the habit of expecting to be recompensed for every trifling
        service he may render. Ali is my slave, and in saving your life he was but
        discharging his duty to me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; interposed Madame de Villefort, on whom the
        authoritative style adopted by the count made a deep impression, &ldquo;nay,
        but consider that to preserve my life he has risked his own.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;His life, madame, belongs not to him; it is mine, in return for my
        having myself saved him from death.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame de Villefort made no further reply; her mind was utterly absorbed in the
        contemplation of the person who, from the first instant she saw him, had made so
        powerful an impression on her.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the evident preoccupation of Madame de Villefort, Monte Cristo scrutinized
        the features and appearance of the boy she kept folded in her arms, lavishing on
        him the most tender endearments. The child was small for his age, and unnaturally
        pale. A mass of straight black hair, defying all attempts to train or curl it,
        fell over his projecting forehead, and hung down to his shoulders, giving increased
        vivacity to eyes already sparkling with a youthful love of mischief and
        fondness for every forbidden enjoyment. His mouth was large, and the lips,
        which had not yet regained their color, were particularly thin; in fact,
        the deep and crafty look, giving a predominant expression to the child&rsquo;s
        face, belonged rather to a boy of twelve or fourteen than to one so young.
        His first movement was to free himself by a violent push from the
        encircling arms of his mother, and to rush forward to the casket from
        whence the count had taken the phial of elixir; then, without asking
        permission of anyone, he proceeded, in all the wilfulness of a spoiled
        child unaccustomed to restrain either whims or caprices, to pull the corks
        out of all the bottles.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Touch nothing, my little friend,&rdquo; cried the count eagerly;
        &ldquo;some of those liquids are not only dangerous to taste, but even to
        inhale.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Madame de Villefort became very pale, and, seizing her son&rsquo;s arm,
        drew him anxiously toward her; but, once satisfied of his safety, she also
        cast a brief but expressive glance on the casket, which was not lost upon
        the count. At this moment Ali entered. At sight of him Madame de Villefort
        uttered an expression of pleasure, and, holding the child still closer
        towards her, she said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Edward, dearest, do you see that good man? He has shown very great courage
        and resolution, for he exposed his own life to stop the horses that were running
        away with us, and would certainly have dashed the carriage to pieces. Thank him,
        then, my child, in your very best manner; for, had he not come to our aid, neither
        you nor I would have been alive to speak our thanks.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The child stuck out his lips and turned away his head in a disdainful manner,
        saying, &ldquo;He&rsquo;s too ugly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20353m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        The count smiled as if the child bade fair to realize his hopes, while
        Madame de Villefort reprimanded her son with a gentleness and moderation
        very far from conveying the least idea of a fault having been committed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This lady,&rdquo; said the Count, speaking to Ali in the Arabic
        language, &ldquo;is desirous that her son should thank you for saving both
        their lives; but the boy refuses, saying you are too ugly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Ali turned his intelligent countenance towards the boy, on whom he gazed
        without any apparent emotion; but the spasmodic working of the nostrils
        showed to the practiced eye of Monte Cristo that the Arab had been wounded
        to the heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Will you permit me to inquire,&rdquo; said Madame de Villefort, as
        she arose to take her leave, &ldquo;whether you usually reside here?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I do not,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo; &ldquo;it is a small
        place I have purchased quite lately. My place of abode is No. 30, Avenue
        des Champs-Élysées; but I see you have quite recovered from your fright,
        and are, no doubt, desirous of returning home. Anticipating your wishes, I
        have desired the same horses you came with to be put to one of my
        carriages, and Ali, he whom you think so very ugly,&rdquo; continued he,
        addressing the boy with a smiling air, &ldquo;will have the honor of
        driving you home, while your coachman remains here to attend to the
        necessary repairs of your calash. As soon as that important business is
        concluded, I will have a pair of my own horses harnessed to convey it
        direct to Madame Danglars.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I dare not return with those dreadful horses,&rdquo; said Madame de
        Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You will see,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo, &ldquo;that they will be
        as different as possible in the hands of Ali. With him they will be gentle
        and docile as lambs.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Ali had, indeed, given proof of this; for, approaching the animals, who had been
        got upon their legs with considerable difficulty, he rubbed their foreheads and
        nostrils with a sponge soaked in aromatic vinegar, and wiped off the sweat and
        foam that covered their mouths. Then, commencing a loud whistling noise, he rubbed
        them well all over their bodies for several minutes; then, undisturbed by
        the noisy crowd collected round the broken carriage, Ali quietly harnessed
        the pacified animals to the count&rsquo;s chariot, took the reins in his
        hands, and mounted the box, when to the utter astonishment of those who
        had witnessed the ungovernable spirit and maddened speed of the same
        horses, he was actually compelled to apply his whip in no very gentle
        manner before he could induce them to start; and even then all that could
        be obtained from the celebrated &ldquo;dappled grays,&rdquo; now changed
        into a couple of dull, sluggish, stupid brutes, was a slow, pottering
        pace, kept up with so much difficulty that Madame de Villefort was more
        than two hours returning to her residence in the Faubourg Saint-Honoré.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20355m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        Scarcely had the first congratulations upon her marvellous escape been
        gone through when she wrote the following letter to Madame Danglars:&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Dear Hermine,&mdash;I have just had a wonderful escape from the
        most imminent danger, and I owe my safety to the very Count of Monte
        Cristo we were talking about yesterday, but whom I little expected to see
        today. I remember how unmercifully I laughed at what I considered your
        eulogistic and exaggerated praises of him; but I have now ample cause to
        admit that your enthusiastic description of this wonderful man fell far
        short of his merits. Your horses got as far as Ranelagh, when they darted
        forward like mad things, and galloped away at so fearful a rate, that
        there seemed no other prospect for myself and my poor Edward but that of
        being dashed to pieces against the first object that impeded their
        progress, when a strange-looking man,&mdash;an Arab, a negro, or a Nubian,
        at least a black of some nation or other&mdash;at a signal from the count,
        whose domestic he is, suddenly seized and stopped the infuriated animals,
        even at the risk of being trampled to death himself; and certainly he must
        have had a most wonderful escape. The count then hastened to us, and took
        us into his house, where he speedily recalled my poor Edward to life. He
        sent us home in his own carriage. Yours will be returned to you tomorrow.
        You will find your horses in bad condition, from the results of this
        accident; they seem thoroughly stupefied, as if sulky and vexed at having
        been conquered by man. The count, however, has commissioned me to assure
        you that two or three days&rsquo; rest, with plenty of barley for their
        sole food during that time, will bring them back to as fine, that is as
        terrifying, a condition as they were in yesterday.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20356m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        Adieu! I cannot return you many thanks for the drive of yesterday; but, after all,
        I ought not to blame you for the misconduct of your horses, more especially as it
        procured me the pleasure of an introduction to the Count of Monte Cristo,&mdash;and
        certainly that illustrious personage, apart from the millions he is said
        to be so very anxious to dispose of, seemed to me one of those curiously
        interesting problems I, for one, delight in solving at any risk, even if
        it were to necessitate another drive to the Bois behind your horses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edward endured the accident with miraculous courage&mdash;he did not utter
        a single cry, but fell lifeless into my arms; nor did a tear fall from his
        eyes after it was over. I doubt not you will consider these praises the
        result of blind maternal affection, but there is a soul of iron in that
        delicate, fragile body. Valentine sends many affectionate remembrances to
        your dear Eugénie. I embrace you with all my heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        Héloïse de Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        P.S.&mdash;Do pray contrive some means for me to meet the Count of Monte
        Cristo at your house. I must and will see him again. I have just made M.
        de Villefort promise to call on him, and I hope the visit will be
        returned.
      </p>
      <p>
        That night the adventure at Auteuil was talked of everywhere. Albert
        related it to his mother; Château-Renaud recounted it at the Jockey Club,
        and Debray detailed it at length in the salons of the minister; even
        Beauchamp accorded twenty lines in his journal to the relation of the
        count&rsquo;s courage and gallantry, thereby celebrating him as the
        greatest hero of the day in the eyes of all the feminine members of the
        aristocracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vast was the crowd of visitors and inquiring friends who left their names at the
        residence of Madame de Villefort, with the design of renewing their visit at the
        right moment, of hearing from her lips all the interesting circumstances of this
        most romantic adventure.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for M. de Villefort, he fulfilled the predictions of Héloïse to the
        letter,&mdash;donned his dress suit, drew on a pair of white gloves,
        ordered the servants to attend the carriage dressed in their full livery,
        and drove that same night to No. 30 in the Avenue des Champs-Élysées.
