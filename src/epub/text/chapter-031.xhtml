      <h2>Chapter 31. Italy: Sinbad the Sailor</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>owards the
        beginning of the year 1838, two young men belonging to the first society
        of Paris, the Viscount Albert de Morcerf and the Baron Franz d&rsquo;Épinay,
        were at Florence. They had agreed to see the Carnival at Rome that year,
        and that Franz, who for the last three or four years had inhabited Italy,
        should act as <i>cicerone</i> to Albert.
      </p>
      <p>
        As it is no inconsiderable affair to spend the Carnival at Rome, especially when
        you have no great desire to sleep on the Piazza del Popolo, or the Campo Vaccino,
        they wrote to Signor Pastrini, the proprietor of the Hôtel de Londres, Piazza di
        Spagna, to reserve comfortable apartments for them. Signor Pastrini replied that
        he had only two rooms and a parlor on the third floor, which he offered at
        the low charge of a louis per diem. They accepted his offer; but wishing
        to make the best use of the time that was left, Albert started for Naples.
        As for Franz, he remained at Florence, and after having passed a few days
        in exploring the paradise of the Cascine, and spending two or three
        evenings at the houses of the Florentine nobility, he took a fancy into
        his head (having already visited Corsica, the cradle of Bonaparte) to
        visit Elba, the waiting-place of Napoleon.
      </p>
      <p>
        One evening he cast off the painter of a sailboat from the iron ring that
        secured it to the dock at Leghorn, wrapped himself in his coat and lay
        down, and said to the crew,&mdash;&ldquo;To the Island of Elba!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The boat shot out of the harbor like a bird and the next morning Franz
        disembarked at Porto-Ferrajo. He traversed the island, after having
        followed the traces which the footsteps of the giant have left, and
        re-embarked for Marciana.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two hours after he again landed at Pianosa, where he was assured that red
        partridges abounded. The sport was bad; Franz only succeeded in killing a few
        partridges, and, like every unsuccessful sportsman, he returned to the boat very
        much out of temper.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, if your excellency chose,&rdquo; said the captain, &ldquo;you
        might have capital sport.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you see that island?&rdquo; continued the captain, pointing to a
        conical pile rising from the indigo sea.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what is this island?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The Island of Monte Cristo.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But I have no permission to shoot over this island.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your excellency does not require a permit, for the island is
        uninhabited.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, indeed!&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;A desert island in
        the midst of the Mediterranean must be a curiosity.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is very natural; this island is a mass of rocks, and does not
        contain an acre of land capable of cultivation.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To whom does this island belong?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To Tuscany.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What game shall I find there!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thousands of wild goats.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Who live upon the stones, I suppose,&rdquo; said Franz with an
        incredulous smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, but by browsing the shrubs and trees that grow out of the
        crevices of the rocks.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where can I sleep?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On shore in the grottos, or on board in your cloak; besides, if
        your excellency pleases, we can leave as soon as you like&mdash;we can
        sail as well by night as by day, and if the wind drops we can use our
        oars.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        As Franz had sufficient time, and his apartments at Rome were not yet
        available, he accepted the proposition. Upon his answer in the
        affirmative, the sailors exchanged a few words together in a low tone.
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; asked he, &ldquo;what now? Is there any difficulty in
        the way?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No.&rdquo; replied the captain, &ldquo;but we must warn your
        excellency that the island is an infected port.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Monte Cristo although uninhabited, yet serves occasionally as a
        refuge for the smugglers and pirates who come from Corsica, Sardinia, and
        Africa, and if it becomes known that we have been there, we shall have to
        perform quarantine for six days on our return to Leghorn.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The deuce! That puts a different face on the matter. Six days! Why,
        that&rsquo;s as long as the Almighty took to make the world! Too long a
        wait&mdash;too long.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But who will say your excellency has been to Monte Cristo?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I shall not,&rdquo; cried Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nor I, nor I,&rdquo; chorused the sailors.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then steer for Monte Cristo.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The captain gave his orders, the helm was put up, and the boat was soon
        sailing in the direction of the island. Franz waited until all was in
        order, and when the sail was filled, and the four sailors had taken their
        places&mdash;three forward, and one at the helm&mdash;he resumed the
        conversation. &ldquo;Gaetano,&rdquo; said he to the captain, &ldquo;you
        tell me Monte Cristo serves as a refuge for pirates, who are, it seems to
        me, a very different kind of game from the goats.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, your excellency, and it is true.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I knew there were smugglers, but I thought that since the capture
        of Algiers, and the destruction of the regency, pirates existed only in
        the romances of Cooper and Captain Marryat.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your excellency is mistaken; there are pirates, like the bandits
        who were believed to have been exterminated by Pope Leo XII., and who yet,
        every day, rob travellers at the gates of Rome. Has not your excellency
        heard that the French <i>chargé d&rsquo;affaires</i> was robbed six months
        ago within five hundred paces of Velletri?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, I heard that.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, if, like us, your excellency lived at Leghorn, you
        would hear, from time to time, that a little merchant vessel, or an
        English yacht that was expected at Bastia, at Porto-Ferrajo, or at Civita
        Vecchia, has not arrived; no one knows what has become of it, but,
        doubtless, it has struck on a rock and foundered. Now this rock it has met
        has been a long and narrow boat, manned by six or eight men, who have
        surprised and plundered it, some dark and stormy night, near some desert
        and gloomy island, as bandits plunder a carriage in the recesses of a
        forest.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; asked Franz, who lay wrapped in his cloak at the bottom
        of the boat, &ldquo;why do not those who have been plundered complain to
        the French, Sardinian, or Tuscan governments?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; said Gaetano with a smile.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, why?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because, in the first place, they transfer from the vessel to their
        own boat whatever they think worth taking, then they bind the crew hand
        and foot, they attach to everyone&rsquo;s neck a four-and-twenty-pound
        ball, a large hole is chopped in the vessel&rsquo;s bottom, and then they
        leave her. At the end of ten minutes the vessel begins to roll heavily and
        settle down. First one gun&rsquo;l goes under, then the other. Then they
        lift and sink again, and both go under at once. All at once there&rsquo;s
        a noise like a cannon&mdash;that&rsquo;s the air blowing up the deck. Soon
        the water rushes out of the scupper-holes like a whale spouting, the
        vessel gives a last groan, spins round and round, and disappears, forming
        a vast whirlpool in the ocean, and then all is over, so that in five
        minutes nothing but the eye of God can see the vessel where she lies at
        the bottom of the sea. Do you understand now,&rdquo; said the captain,
        &ldquo;why no complaints are made to the government, and why the vessel
        never reaches port?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        It is probable that if Gaetano had related this previous to proposing the
        expedition, Franz would have hesitated, but now that they had started, he
        thought it would be cowardly to draw back. He was one of those men who do
        not rashly court danger, but if danger presents itself, combat it with the
        most unalterable coolness. Calm and resolute, he treated any peril as he
        would an adversary in a duel,&mdash;calculated its probable method of
        approach; retreated, if at all, as a point of strategy and not from
        cowardice; was quick to see an opening for attack, and won victory at a
        single thrust.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have travelled through Sicily and
        Calabria&mdash;I have sailed two months in the Archipelago, and yet I never saw
        even the shadow of a bandit or a pirate.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I did not tell your excellency this to deter you from your project,&rdquo;
        replied Gaetano, &ldquo;but you questioned me, and I have answered; that&rsquo;s
        all.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, and your conversation is most interesting; and as I wish to
        enjoy it as long as possible, steer for Monte Cristo.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The wind blew strongly, the boat made six or seven knots an hour, and they
        were rapidly reaching the end of their voyage. As they drew near the
        island seemed to lift from the sea, and the air was so clear that they
        could already distinguish the rocks heaped on one another, like cannon
        balls in an arsenal, with green bushes and trees growing in the crevices.
        As for the sailors, although they appeared perfectly tranquil yet it was
        evident that they were on the alert, and that they carefully watched the
        glassy surface over which they were sailing, and on which a few
        fishing-boats, with their white sails, were alone visible.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were within fifteen miles of Monte Cristo when the sun began to set behind
        Corsica, whose mountains appeared against the sky, showing their rugged
        peaks in bold relief; this mass of rock, like the giant Adamastor, rose
        dead ahead, a formidable barrier, and intercepting the light that gilded
        its massive peaks so that the voyagers were in shadow. Little by little
        the shadow rose higher and seemed to drive before it the last rays of the
        expiring day; at last the reflection rested on the summit of the mountain,
        where it paused an instant, like the fiery crest of a volcano, then gloom
        gradually covered the summit as it had covered the base, and the island
        now only appeared to be a gray mountain that grew continually darker; half
        an hour after, the night was quite dark.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, the mariners were used to these latitudes, and knew every
        rock in the Tuscan Archipelago; for in the midst of this obscurity Franz
        was not without uneasiness&mdash;Corsica had long since disappeared, and
        Monte Cristo itself was invisible; but the sailors seemed, like the lynx,
        to see in the dark, and the pilot who steered did not evince the slightest
        hesitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        An hour had passed since the sun had set, when Franz fancied he saw, at a quarter
        of a mile to the left, a dark mass, but he could not precisely make out what it
        was, and fearing to excite the mirth of the sailors by mistaking a floating cloud
        for land, he remained silent; suddenly a great light appeared on the strand;
        land might resemble a cloud, but the fire was not a meteor.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is this light?&rdquo; asked he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said the captain; &ldquo;it is a fire.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But you told me the island was uninhabited?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I said there were no fixed habitations on it, but I said also that
        it served sometimes as a harbor for smugglers.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And for pirates?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And for pirates,&rdquo; returned Gaetano, repeating Franz&rsquo;s
        words. &ldquo;It is for that reason I have given orders to pass the
        island, for, as you see, the fire is behind us.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But this fire?&rdquo; continued Franz. &ldquo;It seems to me rather
        reassuring than otherwise; men who did not wish to be seen would not light
        a fire.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, that goes for nothing,&rdquo; said Gaetano. &ldquo;If you can
        guess the position of the island in the darkness, you will see that the
        fire cannot be seen from the side or from Pianosa, but only from the sea.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You think, then, this fire indicates the presence of unpleasant
        neighbors?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is what we must find out,&rdquo; returned Gaetano, fixing his
        eyes on this terrestrial star.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How can you find out?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You shall see.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Gaetano consulted with his companions, and after five minutes&rsquo; discussion
        a manœuvre was executed which caused the vessel to tack about, they returned the
        way they had come, and in a few minutes the fire disappeared, hidden by an
        elevation of the land. The pilot again changed the course of the boat, which
        rapidly approached the island, and was soon within fifty paces of it. Gaetano
        lowered the sail, and the boat came to rest. All this was done in silence, and
        from the moment that their course was changed not a word was spoken.
      </p>
      <p>
        Gaetano, who had proposed the expedition, had taken all the responsibility
        on himself; the four sailors fixed their eyes on him, while they got out
        their oars and held themselves in readiness to row away, which, thanks to
        the darkness, would not be difficult. As for Franz, he examined his arms
        with the utmost coolness; he had two double-barrelled guns and a rifle; he
        loaded them, looked at the priming, and waited quietly.
      </p>
      <p>
        During this time the captain had thrown off his vest and shirt, and secured his
        trousers round his waist; his feet were naked, so he had no shoes and stockings
        to take off; after these preparations he placed his finger on his lips, and
        lowering himself noiselessly into the sea, swam towards the shore with
        such precaution that it was impossible to hear the slightest sound; he
        could only be traced by the phosphorescent line in his wake. This track
        soon disappeared; it was evident that he had touched the shore.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone on board remained motionless for half an hour, when the same luminous
        track was again observed, and the swimmer was soon on board.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; exclaimed Franz and the sailors in unison.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They are Spanish smugglers,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;they have with
        them two Corsican bandits.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what are these Corsican bandits doing here with Spanish
        smugglers?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas,&rdquo; returned the captain with an accent of the most
        profound pity, &ldquo;we ought always to help one another. Very often the
        bandits are hard pressed by gendarmes or carbineers; well, they see a
        vessel, and good fellows like us on board, they come and demand
        hospitality of us; you can&rsquo;t refuse help to a poor hunted devil; we
        receive them, and for greater security we stand out to sea. This costs us
        nothing, and saves the life, or at least the liberty, of a
        fellow-creature, who on the first occasion returns the service by pointing
        out some safe spot where we can land our goods without interruption.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Franz, &ldquo;then you are a smuggler occasionally,
        Gaetano?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your excellency, we must live somehow,&rdquo; returned the other,
        smiling impenetrably.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you know the men who are now on Monte Cristo?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, we sailors are like freemasons, and recognize each other
        by signs.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And do you think we have nothing to fear if we land?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing at all; smugglers are not thieves.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But these two Corsican bandits?&rdquo; said Franz, calculating the
        chances of peril.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is not their fault that they are bandits, but that of the
        authorities.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because they are pursued for having made a stiff, as if it was not
        in a Corsican&rsquo;s nature to revenge himself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you mean by having made a stiff?&mdash;having assassinated
        a man?&rdquo; said Franz, continuing his investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I mean that they have killed an enemy, which is a very different
        thing,&rdquo; returned the captain.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;let us demand hospitality
        of these smugglers and bandits. Do you think they will grant it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Without doubt.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How many are they?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Four, and the two bandits make six.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Just our number, so that if they prove troublesome, we shall be
        able to hold them in check; so, for the last time, steer to Monte Cristo.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but your excellency will permit us to take all due
        precautions.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;By all means, be as wise as Nestor and as prudent as Ulysses; I do
        more than permit, I exhort you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Silence, then!&rdquo; said Gaetano.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone obeyed. For a man who, like Franz, viewed his position in its
        true light, it was a grave one. He was alone in the darkness with sailors
        whom he did not know, and who had no reason to be devoted to him; who knew
        that he had several thousand francs in his belt, and who had often
        examined his weapons,&mdash;which were very beautiful,&mdash;if not with
        envy, at least with curiosity. On the other hand, he was about to land,
        without any other escort than these men, on an island which had, indeed, a
        very religious name, but which did not seem to Franz likely to afford him
        much hospitality, thanks to the smugglers and bandits. The history of the
        scuttled vessels, which had appeared improbable during the day, seemed
        very probable at night; placed as he was between two possible sources of
        danger, he kept his eye on the crew, and his gun in his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sailors had again hoisted sail, and the vessel was once more cleaving the
        waves. Through the darkness Franz, whose eyes were now more accustomed to it,
        could see the looming shore along which the boat was sailing, and then, as
        they rounded a rocky point, he saw the fire more brilliant than ever, and
        about it five or six persons seated. The blaze illumined the sea for a
        hundred paces around. Gaetano skirted the light, carefully keeping the
        boat in the shadow; then, when they were opposite the fire, he steered to
        the centre of the circle, singing a fishing song, of which his companions
        sung the chorus.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the first words of the song the men seated round the fire arose and approached
        the landing-place, their eyes fixed on the boat, evidently seeking to know who
        the new-comers were and what were their intentions. They soon appeared satisfied
        and returned (with the exception of one, who remained at the shore) to their
        fire, at which the carcass of a goat was roasting. When the boat was within
        twenty paces of the shore, the man on the beach, who carried a carbine, presented
        arms after the manner of a sentinel, and cried, &ldquo;Who comes there?&rdquo; in
        Sardinian.
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz coolly cocked both barrels. Gaetano then exchanged a few words with this
        man which the traveller did not understand, but which evidently concerned him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Will your excellency give your name, or remain <i>incognito</i>?&rdquo;
        asked the captain.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My name must rest unknown,&rdquo; replied Franz; &ldquo;merely say I am
        a Frenchman travelling for pleasure.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        As soon as Gaetano had transmitted this answer, the sentinel gave an order to one
        of the men seated round the fire, who rose and disappeared among the rocks. Not a
        word was spoken, everyone seemed occupied, Franz with his disembarkment, the
        sailors with their sails, the smugglers with their goat; but in the midst of all
        this carelessness it was evident that they mutually observed each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        The man who had disappeared returned suddenly on the opposite side to that by
        which he had left; he made a sign with his head to the sentinel, who,
        turning to the boat, said, &ldquo;<i>S&rsquo;accommodi</i>.&rdquo; The
        Italian <i>s&rsquo;accommodi</i> is untranslatable; it means at once,
        &ldquo;Come, enter, you are welcome; make yourself at home; you are the
        master.&rdquo; It is like that Turkish phrase of Molière&rsquo;s that so
        astonished the bourgeois gentleman by the number of things implied in its
        utterance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sailors did not wait for a second invitation; four strokes
        of the oar brought them to land; Gaetano sprang to shore, exchanged a few
        words with the sentinel, then his comrades disembarked, and lastly came
        Franz. One of his guns was swung over his shoulder, Gaetano had the other,
        and a sailor held his rifle; his dress, half artist, half dandy, did not
        excite any suspicion, and, consequently, no disquietude. The boat was
        moored to the shore, and they advanced a few paces to find a comfortable
        bivouac; but, doubtless, the spot they chose did not suit the smuggler who
        filled the post of sentinel, for he cried out:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not that way, if you please.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Gaetano faltered an excuse, and advanced to the opposite side, while two
        sailors kindled torches at the fire to light them on their way.
      </p>
      <p>
        They advanced about thirty paces, and then stopped at a small esplanade
        surrounded with rocks, in which seats had been cut, not unlike
        sentry-boxes. Around in the crevices of the rocks grew a few dwarf oaks
        and thick bushes of myrtles. Franz lowered a torch, and saw by the mass of
        cinders that had accumulated that he was not the first to discover this
        retreat, which was, doubtless, one of the halting-places of the wandering
        visitors of Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for his suspicions, once on <i>terra firma</i>, once that he had seen the
        indifferent, if not friendly, appearance of his hosts, his anxiety had quite
        disappeared, or rather, at sight of the goat, had turned to appetite. He mentioned
        this to Gaetano, who replied that nothing could be more easy than to prepare a
        supper when they had in their boat, bread, wine, half a dozen partridges, and a
        good fire to roast them by.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;if the smell of their roast meat tempts
        you, I will go and offer them two of our birds for a slice.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are a born diplomat,&rdquo; returned Franz; &ldquo;go and try.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile the sailors had collected dried sticks and branches with which
        they made a fire. Franz waited impatiently, inhaling the aroma of the
        roasted meat, when the captain returned with a mysterious air.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Franz, &ldquo;anything new?&mdash;do they refuse?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; returned Gaetano, &ldquo;the chief, who was
        told you were a young Frenchman, invites you to sup with him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; observed Franz, &ldquo;this chief is very polite, and
        I see no objection&mdash;the more so as I bring my share of the supper.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, it is not that; he has plenty, and to spare, for supper; but he
        makes one condition, and rather a peculiar one, before he will receive you
        at his house.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;His house? Has he built one here, then?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, but he has a very comfortable one all the same, so they say.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You know this chief, then?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have heard talk of him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Favorably or otherwise?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Both.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The deuce!&mdash;and what is this condition?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That you are blindfolded, and do not take off the bandage until he
        himself bids you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz looked at Gaetano, to see, if possible, what he thought of this proposal.
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; replied he, guessing Franz&rsquo;s thought, &ldquo;I know this
        is a serious matter.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What should you do in my place?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I, who have nothing to lose,&mdash;I should go.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20075m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You would accept?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, were it only out of curiosity.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There is something very peculiar about this chief, then?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Gaetano, lowering his voice, &ldquo;I do not
        know if what they say is true&rdquo;&mdash;he stopped to see if anyone was
        near.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do they say?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That this chief inhabits a cavern to which the Pitti Palace is
        nothing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; said Franz, reseating himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is no nonsense; it is quite true. Cama, the pilot of the <i>Saint
        Ferdinand</i>, went in once, and he came back amazed, vowing that such
        treasures were only to be heard of in fairy tales.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; observed Franz, &ldquo;that with such stories
        you make me think of Ali Baba&rsquo;s enchanted cavern?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I tell you what I have been told.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you advise me to accept?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t say that; your excellency will do as you please;
        I should be sorry to advise you in the matter.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz pondered the matter for a few moments, concluded that a man so rich
        could not have any intention of plundering him of what little he had, and
        seeing only the prospect of a good supper, accepted. Gaetano departed with
        the reply. Franz was prudent, and wished to learn all he possibly could
        concerning his host. He turned towards the sailor, who, during this
        dialogue, had sat gravely plucking the partridges with the air of a man
        proud of his office, and asked him how these men had landed, as no vessel
        of any kind was visible.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; returned the sailor, &ldquo;I know their
        vessel.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is it a very beautiful vessel?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I would not wish for a better to sail round the world.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of what burden is she?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;About a hundred tons; but she is built to stand any weather. She is
        what the English call a yacht.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where was she built?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I know not; but my own opinion is she is a Genoese.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And how did a leader of smugglers,&rdquo; continued Franz, &ldquo;venture
        to build a vessel designed for such a purpose at Genoa?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I did not say that the owner was a smuggler,&rdquo; replied the
        sailor.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; but Gaetano did, I thought.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Gaetano had only seen the vessel from a distance, he had not then
        spoken to anyone.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And if this person be not a smuggler, who is he?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A wealthy signor, who travels for his pleasure.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; thought Franz, &ldquo;he is still more mysterious,
        since the two accounts do not agree.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If you ask him, he says Sinbad the Sailor; but I doubt if it be his
        real name.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sinbad the Sailor?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And where does he reside?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On the sea.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What country does he come from?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not know.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you ever seen him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sometimes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What sort of a man is he?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your excellency will judge for yourself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where will he receive me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No doubt in the subterranean palace Gaetano told you of.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you never had the curiosity, when you have landed and found
        this island deserted, to seek for this enchanted palace?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes, more than once, but always in vain; we examined the grotto
        all over, but we never could find the slightest trace of any opening; they
        say that the door is not opened by a key, but a magic word.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Decidedly,&rdquo; muttered Franz, &ldquo;this is an Arabian Nights&rsquo;
        adventure.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;His excellency waits for you,&rdquo; said a voice, which he
        recognized as that of the sentinel. He was accompanied by two of the yacht&rsquo;s
        crew.
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz drew his handkerchief from his pocket, and presented it to the
        man who had spoken to him. Without uttering a word, they bandaged his eyes
        with a care that showed their apprehensions of his committing some
        indiscretion. Afterwards he was made to promise that he would not make the
        least attempt to raise the bandage. He promised.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then his two guides took his arms, and he went on, guided by them, and
        preceded by the sentinel. After going about thirty paces, he smelt the
        appetizing odor of the kid that was roasting, and knew thus that he was
        passing the bivouac; they then led him on about fifty paces farther,
        evidently advancing towards that part of the shore where they would not
        allow Gaetano to go&mdash;a refusal he could now comprehend.
      </p>
      <p>
        Presently, by a change in the atmosphere, he knew that they were entering a cave;
        after going on for a few seconds more he heard a crackling, and it seemed to him
        as though the atmosphere again changed, and became balmy and perfumed. At
        length his feet touched on a thick and soft carpet, and his guides let go
        their hold of him. There was a moment&rsquo;s silence, and then a voice,
        in excellent French, although, with a foreign accent, said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Welcome, sir. I beg you will remove your bandage.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        It may be supposed, then, Franz did not wait for a repetition of this permission,
        but took off the handkerchief, and found himself in the presence of a man
        from thirty-eight to forty years of age, dressed in a Tunisian costume,
        that is to say, a red cap with a long blue silk tassel, a vest of black
        cloth embroidered with gold, pantaloons of deep red, large and full
        gaiters of the same color, embroidered with gold like the vest, and yellow
        slippers; he had a splendid cashmere round his waist, and a small sharp
        and crooked cangiar was passed through his girdle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although of a paleness that was almost livid, this man had a remarkably
        handsome face; his eyes were penetrating and sparkling; his nose, quite
        straight, and projecting direct from the brow, was of the pure Greek type,
        while his teeth, as white as pearls, were set off to admiration by the
        black moustache that encircled them.
      </p>
      <p>
        His pallor was so peculiar, that it seemed to pertain to one who had been
        long entombed, and who was incapable of resuming the healthy glow and hue
        of life. He was not particularly tall, but extremely well made, and, like
        the men of the South, had small hands and feet. But what astonished Franz,
        who had treated Gaetano&rsquo;s description as a fable, was the splendor
        of the apartment in which he found himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The entire chamber was lined with crimson brocade, worked with flowers of
        gold. In a recess was a kind of divan, surmounted with a stand of Arabian
        swords in silver scabbards, and the handles resplendent with gems; from
        the ceiling hung a lamp of Venetian glass, of beautiful shape and color,
        while the feet rested on a Turkey carpet, in which they sunk to the
        instep; tapestry hung before the door by which Franz had entered, and also
        in front of another door, leading into a second apartment which seemed to
        be brilliantly illuminated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The host gave Franz time to recover from his surprise, and, moreover,
        returned look for look, not even taking his eyes off him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said, after a pause, &ldquo;a thousand excuses for
        the precaution taken in your introduction hither; but as, during the
        greater portion of the year, this island is deserted, if the secret of
        this abode were discovered, I should doubtless, find on my return my
        temporary retirement in a state of great disorder, which would be
        exceedingly annoying, not for the loss it occasioned me, but because I
        should not have the certainty I now possess of separating myself from all
        the rest of mankind at pleasure. Let me now endeavor to make you forget
        this temporary unpleasantness, and offer you what no doubt you did not
        expect to find here&mdash;that is to say, a tolerable supper and pretty
        comfortable beds.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Ma foi</i>, my dear sir,&rdquo; replied Franz, &ldquo;make no
        apologies. I have always observed that they bandage people&rsquo;s eyes
        who penetrate enchanted palaces, for instance, those of Raoul in the <i>Huguenots</i>,
        and really I have nothing to complain of, for what I see makes me think of
        the wonders of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20079m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas! I may say with Lucullus, if I could have anticipated the
        honor of your visit, I would have prepared for it. But such as is my
        hermitage, it is at your disposal; such as is my supper, it is yours to
        share, if you will. Ali, is the supper ready?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment the tapestry moved aside, and a Nubian, black as ebony, and
        dressed in a plain white tunic, made a sign to his master that all was
        prepared in the dining-room.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the unknown to Franz, &ldquo;I do not know if you
        are of my opinion, but I think nothing is more annoying than to remain two
        or three hours together without knowing by name or appellation how to
        address one another. Pray observe, that I too much respect the laws of
        hospitality to ask your name or title. I only request you to give me one
        by which I may have the pleasure of addressing you. As for myself, that I
        may put you at your ease, I tell you that I am generally called &lsquo;Sinbad
        the Sailor.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And I,&rdquo; replied Franz, &ldquo;will tell you, as I only
        require his wonderful lamp to make me precisely like Aladdin, that I see
        no reason why at this moment I should not be called Aladdin. That will
        keep us from going away from the East whither I am tempted to think I have
        been conveyed by some good genius.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, Signor Aladdin,&rdquo; replied the singular Amphitryon,
        &ldquo;you heard our repast announced, will you now take the trouble to
        enter the dining-room, your humble servant going first to show the way?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At these words, moving aside the tapestry, Sinbad preceded his guest.
        Franz now looked upon another scene of enchantment; the table was
        splendidly covered, and once convinced of this important point he cast his
        eyes around him. The dining-room was scarcely less striking than the room
        he had just left; it was entirely of marble, with antique bas-reliefs of
        priceless value; and at the four corners of this apartment, which was
        oblong, were four magnificent statues, having baskets in their hands.
        These baskets contained four pyramids of most splendid fruit; there were
        Sicily pine-apples, pomegranates from Malaga, oranges from the Balearic
        Isles, peaches from France, and dates from Tunis.
      </p>
      <p>
        The supper consisted of a roast pheasant garnished with Corsican blackbirds;
        a boar&rsquo;s ham with jelly, a quarter of a kid with tartar sauce, a glorious
        turbot, and a gigantic lobster. Between these large dishes were smaller ones
        containing various dainties. The dishes were of silver, and the plates of Japanese
        china.
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz rubbed his eyes in order to assure himself that this was not a
        dream. Ali alone was present to wait at table, and acquitted himself so
        admirably, that the guest complimented his host thereupon.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied he, while he did the honors of the supper with
        much ease and grace&mdash;&ldquo;yes, he is a poor devil who is much
        devoted to me, and does all he can to prove it. He remembers that I saved
        his life, and as he has a regard for his head, he feels some gratitude
        towards me for having kept it on his shoulders.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Ali approached his master, took his hand, and kissed it.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Would it be impertinent, Signor Sinbad,&rdquo; said Franz, &ldquo;to
        ask you the particulars of this kindness?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20081m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, they are simple enough,&rdquo; replied the host. &ldquo;It
        seems the fellow had been caught wandering nearer to the harem of the Bey
        of Tunis than etiquette permits to one of his color, and he was condemned
        by the Bey to have his tongue cut out, and his hand and head cut off; the
        tongue the first day, the hand the second, and the head the third. I
        always had a desire to have a mute in my service, so learning the day his
        tongue was cut out, I went to the Bey, and proposed to give him for Ali a
        splendid double-barreled gun, which I knew he was very desirous of having.
        He hesitated a moment, he was so very desirous to complete the poor devil&rsquo;s
        punishment. But when I added to the gun an English cutlass with which I
        had shivered his highness&rsquo;s yataghan to pieces, the Bey yielded, and
        agreed to forgive the hand and head, but on condition that the poor fellow
        never again set foot in Tunis. This was a useless clause in the bargain,
        for whenever the coward sees the first glimpse of the shores of Africa, he
        runs down below, and can only be induced to appear again when we are out
        of sight of that quarter of the globe.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz remained a moment silent and pensive, hardly knowing what to think
        of the half-kindness, half-cruelty, with which his host related the brief
        narrative.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And like the celebrated sailor whose name you have assumed,&rdquo;
        he said, by way of changing the conversation, &ldquo;you pass your life in
        travelling?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes. I made a vow at a time when I little thought I should ever be
        able to accomplish it,&rdquo; said the unknown with a singular smile;
        &ldquo;and I made some others also which I hope I may fulfil in due season.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Sinbad pronounced these words with much calmness, his eyes gave forth
        gleams of extraordinary ferocity.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have suffered a great deal, sir?&rdquo; said Franz inquiringly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sinbad started and looked fixedly at him, as he replied, &ldquo;What makes
        you suppose so?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Everything,&rdquo; answered Franz,&mdash;&ldquo;your voice, your
        look, your pallid complexion, and even the life you lead.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I?&mdash;I live the happiest life possible, the real life of a
        pasha. I am king of all creation. I am pleased with one place, and stay
        there; I get tired of it, and leave it; I am free as a bird and have wings
        like one; my attendants obey my slightest wish. Sometimes I amuse myself
        by delivering some bandit or criminal from the bonds of the law. Then I
        have my mode of dispensing justice, silent and sure, without respite or
        appeal, which condemns or pardons, and which no one sees. Ah, if you had
        tasted my life, you would not desire any other, and would never return to
        the world unless you had some great project to accomplish there.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Revenge, for instance!&rdquo; observed Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        The unknown fixed on the young man one of those looks which penetrate into
        the depth of the heart and thoughts. &ldquo;And why revenge?&rdquo; he
        asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because,&rdquo; replied Franz, &ldquo;you seem to me like a man
        who, persecuted by society, has a fearful account to settle with it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; responded Sinbad, laughing with his singular laugh,
        which displayed his white and sharp teeth. &ldquo;You have not guessed
        rightly. Such as you see me I am, a sort of philosopher, and one day
        perhaps I shall go to Paris to rival Monsieur Appert, and the man in the
        little blue cloak.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And will that be the first time you ever took that journey?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; it will. I must seem to you by no means curious, but I assure
        you that it is not my fault I have delayed it so long&mdash;it will happen
        one day or the other.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20083m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And do you propose to make this journey very shortly?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not know; it depends on circumstances which depend on certain
        arrangements.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I should like to be there at the time you come, and I will endeavor
        to repay you, as far as lies in my power, for your liberal hospitality
        displayed to me at Monte Cristo.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I should avail myself of your offer with pleasure,&rdquo; replied
        the host, &ldquo;but, unfortunately, if I go there, it will be, in all
        probability, <i>incognito</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The supper appeared to have been supplied solely for Franz, for the
        unknown scarcely touched one or two dishes of the splendid banquet to
        which his guest did ample justice. Then Ali brought on the dessert, or
        rather took the baskets from the hands of the statues and placed them on
        the table. Between the two baskets he placed a small silver cup with a
        silver cover. The care with which Ali placed this cup on the table roused
        Franz&rsquo;s curiosity. He raised the cover and saw a kind of greenish
        paste, something like preserved angelica, but which was perfectly unknown
        to him. He replaced the lid, as ignorant of what the cup contained as he
        was before he had looked at it, and then casting his eyes towards his host
        he saw him smile at his disappointment.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You cannot guess,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what there is in that
        small vase, can you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I really cannot.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, then, that green preserve is nothing less than the ambrosia
        which Hebe served at the table of Jupiter.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; replied Franz, &ldquo;this ambrosia, no doubt, in
        passing through mortal hands has lost its heavenly appellation and assumed
        a human name; in vulgar phrase, what may you term this composition, for
        which, to tell the truth, I do not feel any particular desire?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, thus it is that our material origin is revealed,&rdquo; cried
        Sinbad; &ldquo;we frequently pass so near to happiness without seeing,
        without regarding it, or if we do see and regard it, yet without
        recognizing it. Are you a man for the substantials, and is gold your god?
        taste this, and the mines of Peru, Guzerat, and Golconda are opened to
        you. Are you a man of imagination&mdash;a poet? taste this, and the
        boundaries of possibility disappear; the fields of infinite space open to
        you, you advance free in heart, free in mind, into the boundless realms of
        unfettered reverie. Are you ambitious, and do you seek after the
        greatnesses of the earth? taste this, and in an hour you will be a king,
        not a king of a petty kingdom hidden in some corner of Europe like France,
        Spain, or England, but king of the world, king of the universe, king of
        creation; without bowing at the feet of Satan, you will be king and master
        of all the kingdoms of the earth. Is it not tempting what I offer you, and
        is it not an easy thing, since it is only to do thus? look!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At these words he uncovered the small cup which contained the substance so
        lauded, took a teaspoonful of the magic sweetmeat, raised it to his lips,
        and swallowed it slowly with his eyes half shut and his head bent
        backwards. Franz did not disturb him whilst he absorbed his favorite
        sweetmeat, but when he had finished, he inquired:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What, then, is this precious stuff?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you ever hear,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;of the Old Man of the
        Mountain, who attempted to assassinate Philippe Auguste?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of course I have.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, you know he reigned over a rich valley which was overhung by
        the mountain whence he derived his picturesque name. In this valley were
        magnificent gardens planted by Hassen-ben-Sabah, and in these gardens
        isolated pavilions. Into these pavilions he admitted the elect, and there,
        says Marco Polo, gave them to eat a certain herb, which transported them
        to Paradise, in the midst of ever-blooming shrubs, ever-ripe fruit, and
        ever-lovely virgins. What these happy persons took for reality was but a
        dream; but it was a dream so soft, so voluptuous, so enthralling, that
        they sold themselves body and soul to him who gave it to them, and
        obedient to his orders as to those of a deity, struck down the designated
        victim, died in torture without a murmur, believing that the death they
        underwent was but a quick transition to that life of delights of which the
        holy herb, now before you, had given them a slight foretaste.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; cried Franz, &ldquo;it is hashish! I know that&mdash;by
        name at least.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is it precisely, Signor Aladdin; it is hashish&mdash;the
        purest and most unadulterated hashish of Alexandria,&mdash;the hashish of
        Abou-Gor, the celebrated maker, the only man, the man to whom there should
        be built a palace, inscribed with these words, <i>A grateful world to the
        dealer in happiness</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Franz, &ldquo;I have a very great
        inclination to judge for myself of the truth or exaggeration of your
        eulogies.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Judge for yourself, Signor Aladdin&mdash;judge, but do not confine
        yourself to one trial. Like everything else, we must habituate the senses
        to a fresh impression, gentle or violent, sad or joyous. There is a
        struggle in nature against this divine substance,&mdash;in nature which is
        not made for joy and clings to pain. Nature subdued must yield in the
        combat, the dream must succeed to reality, and then the dream reigns
        supreme, then the dream becomes life, and life becomes the dream. But what
        changes occur! It is only by comparing the pains of actual being with the
        joys of the assumed existence, that you would desire to live no longer,
        but to dream thus forever. When you return to this mundane sphere from
        your visionary world, you would seem to leave a Neapolitan spring for a
        Lapland winter&mdash;to quit paradise for earth&mdash;heaven for hell!
        Taste the hashish, guest of mine&mdash;taste the hashish.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Franz&rsquo;s only reply was to take a teaspoonful of the marvellous
        preparation, about as much in quantity as his host had eaten, and lift it
        to his mouth.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Diable!</i>&rdquo; he said, after having swallowed the divine
        preserve. &ldquo;I do not know if the result will be as agreeable as you
        describe, but the thing does not appear to me as palatable as you say.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because your palate his not yet been attuned to the sublimity of
        the substances it flavors. Tell me, the first time you tasted oysters,
        tea, porter, truffles, and sundry other dainties which you now adore, did
        you like them? Could you comprehend how the Romans stuffed their pheasants
        with assafœtida, and the Chinese eat swallows&rsquo; nests? Eh? no! Well,
        it is the same with hashish; only eat for a week, and nothing in the world
        will seem to you to equal the delicacy of its flavor, which now appears to
        you flat and distasteful. Let us now go into the adjoining chamber, which
        is your apartment, and Ali will bring us coffee and pipes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        They both arose, and while he who called himself Sinbad&mdash;and whom we
        have occasionally named so, that we might, like his guest, have some title
        by which to distinguish him&mdash;gave some orders to the servant, Franz
        entered still another apartment.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was simply yet richly furnished. It was round, and a large divan
        completely encircled it. Divan, walls, ceiling, floor, were all covered
        with magnificent skins as soft and downy as the richest carpets; there
        were heavy-maned lion-skins from Atlas, striped tiger-skins from Bengal;
        panther-skins from the Cape, spotted beautifully, like those that appeared
        to Dante; bear-skins from Siberia, fox-skins from Norway, and so on; and
        all these skins were strewn in profusion one on the other, so that it
        seemed like walking over the most mossy turf, or reclining on the most
        luxurious bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both laid themselves down on the divan; chibouques with jasmine tubes and
        amber mouthpieces were within reach, and all prepared so that there was no
        need to smoke the same pipe twice. Each of them took one, which Ali
        lighted and then retired to prepare the coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was a moment&rsquo;s silence, during which Sinbad gave himself up to
        thoughts that seemed to occupy him incessantly, even in the midst of his
        conversation; and Franz abandoned himself to that mute reverie, into which
        we always sink when smoking excellent tobacco, which seems to remove with
        its fume all the troubles of the mind, and to give the smoker in exchange
        all the visions of the soul. Ali brought in the coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How do you take it?&rdquo; inquired the unknown; &ldquo;in the
        French or Turkish style, strong or weak, sugar or none, cool or boiling?
        As you please; it is ready in all ways.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will take it in the Turkish style,&rdquo; replied Franz.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you are right,&rdquo; said his host; &ldquo;it shows you have a
        tendency for an Oriental life. Ah, those Orientals; they are the only men
        who know how to live. As for me,&rdquo; he added, with one of those
        singular smiles which did not escape the young man, &ldquo;when I have
        completed my affairs in Paris, I shall go and die in the East; and should
        you wish to see me again, you must seek me at Cairo, Bagdad, or Ispahan.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20087m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Ma foi</i>,&rdquo; said Franz, &ldquo;it would be the easiest
        thing in the world; for I feel eagle&rsquo;s wings springing out at my
        shoulders, and with those wings I could make a tour of the world in
        four-and-twenty hours.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, yes, the hashish is beginning its work. Well, unfurl your
        wings, and fly into superhuman regions; fear nothing, there is a watch
        over you; and if your wings, like those of Icarus, melt before the sun, we
        are here to ease your fall.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He then said something in Arabic to Ali, who made a sign of obedience and
        withdrew, but not to any distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        As to Franz a strange transformation had taken place in him. All the
        bodily fatigue of the day, all the preoccupation of mind which the events
        of the evening had brought on, disappeared as they do at the first
        approach of sleep, when we are still sufficiently conscious to be aware of
        the coming of slumber. His body seemed to acquire an airy lightness, his
        perception brightened in a remarkable manner, his senses seemed to
        redouble their power, the horizon continued to expand; but it was not the
        gloomy horizon of vague alarms, and which he had seen before he slept, but
        a blue, transparent, unbounded horizon, with all the blue of the ocean,
        all the spangles of the sun, all the perfumes of the summer breeze; then,
        in the midst of the songs of his sailors,&mdash;songs so clear and
        sonorous, that they would have made a divine harmony had their notes been
        taken down,&mdash;he saw the Island of Monte Cristo, no longer as a
        threatening rock in the midst of the waves, but as an oasis in the desert;
        then, as his boat drew nearer, the songs became louder, for an enchanting
        and mysterious harmony rose to heaven, as if some Loreley had decreed to
        attract a soul thither, or Amphion, the enchanter, intended there to build
        a city.
      </p>
      <p>
        At length the boat touched the shore, but without effort, without shock,
        as lips touch lips; and he entered the grotto amidst continued strains of
        most delicious melody. He descended, or rather seemed to descend, several
        steps, inhaling the fresh and balmy air, like that which may be supposed
        to reign around the grotto of Circe, formed from such perfumes as set the
        mind a-dreaming, and such fires as burn the very senses; and he saw again
        all he had seen before his sleep, from Sinbad, his singular host, to Ali,
        the mute attendant; then all seemed to fade away and become confused
        before his eyes, like the last shadows of the magic lantern before it is
        extinguished, and he was again in the chamber of statues, lighted only by
        one of those pale and antique lamps which watch in the dead of the night
        over the sleep of pleasure.
      </p>
      <p>
        They were the same statues, rich in form, in attraction, and poesy, with
        eyes of fascination, smiles of love, and bright and flowing hair. They
        were Phryne, Cleopatra, Messalina, those three celebrated courtesans. Then
        among them glided like a pure ray, like a Christian angel in the midst of
        Olympus, one of those chaste figures, those calm shadows, those soft
        visions, which seemed to veil its virgin brow before these marble wantons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then the three statues advanced towards him with looks of love, and
        approached the couch on which he was reposing, their feet hidden in their
        long white tunics, their throats bare, hair flowing like waves, and
        assuming attitudes which the gods could not resist, but which saints
        withstood, and looks inflexible and ardent like those with which the
        serpent charms the bird; and then he gave way before looks that held him
        in a torturing grasp and delighted his senses as with a voluptuous kiss.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seemed to Franz that he closed his eyes, and in a last look about him
        saw the vision of modesty completely veiled; and then followed a dream of
        passion like that promised by the Prophet to the elect. Lips of stone
        turned to flame, breasts of ice became like heated lava, so that to Franz,
        yielding for the first time to the sway of the drug, love was a sorrow and
        voluptuousness a torture, as burning mouths were pressed to his thirsty
        lips, and he was held in cool serpent-like embraces. The more he strove
        against this unhallowed passion the more his senses yielded to its thrall,
        and at length, weary of a struggle that taxed his very soul, he gave way
        and sank back breathless and exhausted beneath the kisses of these marble
        goddesses, and the enchantment of his marvellous dream.
