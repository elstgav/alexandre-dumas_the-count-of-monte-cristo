      <h2>Chapter 68. A Summer Ball</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he same day during
        the interview between Madame Danglars and the procureur, a
        travelling-carriage entered the Rue du Helder, passed through the gateway
        of No. 27, and stopped in the yard. In a moment the door was opened, and
        Madame de Morcerf alighted, leaning on her son&rsquo;s arm. Albert soon
        left her, ordered his horses, and having arranged his toilet, drove to the
        Champs-Élysées, to the house of Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        The count received him with his habitual smile. It was a strange thing that no one
        ever appeared to advance a step in that man&rsquo;s favor. Those who would, as it
        were, force a passage to his heart, found an impassable barrier. Morcerf, who
        ran towards him with open arms, was chilled as he drew near, in spite of
        the friendly smile, and simply held out his hand. Monte Cristo shook it
        coldly, according to his invariable practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Here I am, dear count.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Welcome home again.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I arrived an hour since.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;From Dieppe?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, from Tréport.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And I have come at once to see you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is extremely kind of you,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo with a tone
        of perfect indifference.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what is the news?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You should not ask a stranger, a foreigner, for news.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I know it, but in asking for news, I mean, have you done anything
        for me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Had you commissioned me?&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, feigning
        uneasiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Albert, &ldquo;do not assume so much
        indifference. It is said, sympathy travels rapidly, and when at Tréport, I
        felt the electric shock; you have either been working for me or thinking
        of me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, &ldquo;I have indeed thought of
        you, but the magnetic wire I was guiding acted, indeed, without my
        knowledge.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30277m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed! Pray tell me how it happened.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Willingly. M. Danglars dined with me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I know it; to avoid meeting him, my mother and I left town.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But he met here M. Andrea Cavalcanti.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your Italian prince?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not so fast; M. Andrea only calls himself count.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Calls himself, do you say?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, calls himself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is he not a count?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What can I know of him? He calls himself so. I, of course, give him
        the same title, and everyone else does likewise.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What a strange man you are! What next? You say M. Danglars dined
        here?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, with Count Cavalcanti, the marquis his father, Madame
        Danglars, M. and Madame de Villefort,&mdash;charming people,&mdash;M.
        Debray, Maximilian Morrel, and M. de Château-Renaud.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did they speak of me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not a word.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So much the worse.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why so? I thought you wished them to forget you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If they did not speak of me, I am sure they thought about me, and I
        am in despair.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How will that affect you, since Mademoiselle Danglars was not among
        the number here who thought of you? Truly, she might have thought of you
        at home.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have no fear of that; or, if she did, it was only in the same way
        in which I think of her.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Touching sympathy! So you hate each other?&rdquo; said the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said Morcerf&mdash;&ldquo;if Mademoiselle Danglars
        were disposed to take pity on my supposed martyrdom on her account, and
        would dispense with all matrimonial formalities between our two families,
        I am ready to agree to the arrangement. In a word, Mademoiselle Danglars
        would make a charming mistress&mdash;but a wife&mdash;<i>diable!</i>&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And this,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, &ldquo;is your opinion of your
        intended spouse?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; it is rather unkind, I acknowledge, but it is true. But as
        this dream cannot be realized, since Mademoiselle Danglars must become my
        lawful wife, live perpetually with me, sing to me, compose verses and
        music within ten paces of me, and that for my whole life, it frightens me.
        One may forsake a mistress, but a wife,&mdash;good heavens! There she must
        always be; and to marry Mademoiselle Danglars would be awful.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are difficult to please, viscount.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, for I often wish for what is impossible.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To find such a wife as my father found.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo turned pale, and looked at Albert, while playing with some
        magnificent pistols.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your father was fortunate, then?&rdquo; said he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You know my opinion of my mother, count; look at her,&mdash;still
        beautiful, witty, more charming than ever. For any other son to have
        stayed with his mother for four days at Tréport, it would have been a
        condescension or a martyrdom, while I return, more contented, more
        peaceful&mdash;shall I say more poetic!&mdash;than if I had taken Queen
        Mab or Titania as my companion.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30279m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is an overwhelming demonstration, and you would make everyone
        vow to live a single life.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Such are my reasons for not liking to marry Mademoiselle Danglars.
        Have you ever noticed how much a thing is heightened in value when we
        obtain possession of it? The diamond which glittered in the window at
        Marlé&rsquo;s or Fossin&rsquo;s shines with more splendor when it is our
        own; but if we are compelled to acknowledge the superiority of another,
        and still must retain the one that is inferior, do you not know what we
        have to endure?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Worldling,&rdquo; murmured the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thus I shall rejoice when Mademoiselle Eugénie perceives I am but a
        pitiful atom, with scarcely as many hundred thousand francs as she has
        millions.&rdquo; Monte Cristo smiled. &ldquo;One plan occurred to me,&rdquo;
        continued Albert; &ldquo;Franz likes all that is eccentric; I tried to
        make him fall in love with Mademoiselle Danglars; but in spite of four
        letters, written in the most alluring style, he invariably answered:
        &lsquo;My eccentricity may be great, but it will not make me break my
        promise.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is what I call devoted friendship, to recommend to another one
        whom you would not marry yourself.&rdquo; Albert smiled.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Apropos,&rdquo; continued he, &ldquo;Franz is coming soon, but it will
        not interest you; you dislike him, I think?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I?&rdquo; said Monte Cristo; &ldquo;my dear viscount, how have you
        discovered that I did not like M. Franz! I like everyone.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you include me in the expression everyone&mdash;many thanks!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us not mistake,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo; &ldquo;I love
        everyone as God commands us to love our neighbor, as Christians; but I
        thoroughly hate but a few. Let us return to M. Franz d&rsquo;Épinay. Did
        you say he was coming?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; summoned by M. de Villefort, who is apparently as anxious to
        get Mademoiselle Valentine married as M. Danglars is to see Mademoiselle
        Eugénie settled. It must be a very irksome office to be the father of a
        grown-up daughter; it seems to make one feverish, and to raise one&rsquo;s
        pulse to ninety beats a minute until the deed is done.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But M. d&rsquo;Épinay, unlike you, bears his misfortune patiently.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Still more, he talks seriously about the matter, puts on a white
        tie, and speaks of his family. He entertains a very high opinion of M. and
        Madame de Villefort.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Which they deserve, do they not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I believe they do. M. de Villefort has always passed for a severe
        but a just man.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There is, then, one,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, &ldquo;whom you do
        not condemn like poor Danglars?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because I am not compelled to marry his daughter perhaps,&rdquo;
        replied Albert, laughing.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed, my dear sir,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, &ldquo;you are
        revoltingly foppish.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I foppish? how do you mean?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; pray take a cigar, and cease to defend yourself, and to
        struggle to escape marrying Mademoiselle Danglars. Let things take their
        course; perhaps you may not have to retract.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bah!&rdquo; said Albert, staring.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Doubtless, my dear viscount, you will not be taken by force; and
        seriously, do you wish to break off your engagement?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I would give a hundred thousand francs to be able to do so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then make yourself quite easy. M. Danglars would give double that
        sum to attain the same end.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Am I, indeed, so happy?&rdquo; said Albert, who still could not
        prevent an almost imperceptible cloud passing across his brow. &ldquo;But,
        my dear count, has M. Danglars any reason?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah! there is your proud and selfish nature. You would expose the
        self-love of another with a hatchet, but you shrink if your own is
        attacked with a needle.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But yet, M. Danglars appeared&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Delighted with you, was he not? Well, he is a man of bad taste, and
        is still more enchanted with another. I know not whom; look and judge for
        yourself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thank you, I understand. But my mother&mdash;no, not my mother; I
        mistake&mdash;my father intends giving a ball.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A ball at this season?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Summer balls are fashionable.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If they were not, the countess has only to wish it, and they would
        become so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are right; You know they are select affairs; those who remain
        in Paris in July must be true Parisians. Will you take charge of our
        invitation to Messieurs Cavalcanti?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;When will it take place?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On Saturday.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. Cavalcanti&rsquo;s father will be gone.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But the son will be here; will you invite young M. Cavalcanti?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not know him, viscount.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You do not know him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I never saw him until a few days since, and am not responsible
        for him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But you receive him at your house?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is another thing: he was recommended to me by a good abbé, who
        may be deceived. Give him a direct invitation, but do not ask me to
        present him. If he were afterwards to marry Mademoiselle Danglars, you
        would accuse me of intrigue, and would be challenging me,&mdash;besides, I
        may not be there myself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At your ball.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why should you not be there?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because you have not yet invited me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But I come expressly for that purpose.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are very kind, but I may be prevented.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If I tell you one thing, you will be so amiable as to set aside all
        impediments.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Tell me what it is.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My mother begs you to come.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The Comtesse de Morcerf?&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, starting.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, count,&rdquo; said Albert, &ldquo;I assure you Madame de
        Morcerf speaks freely to me, and if you have not felt those sympathetic
        fibres of which I spoke just now thrill within you, you must be entirely
        devoid of them, for during the last four days we have spoken of no one
        else.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have talked of me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, that is the penalty of being a living puzzle!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then I am also a puzzle to your mother? I should have thought her
        too reasonable to be led by imagination.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A problem, my dear count, for everyone&mdash;for my mother as well
        as others; much studied, but not solved, you still remain an enigma, do
        not fear. My mother is only astonished that you remain so long unsolved. I
        believe, while the Countess G&mdash;&mdash; takes you for Lord Ruthven, my
        mother imagines you to be Cagliostro or the Count Saint-Germain. The first
        opportunity you have, confirm her in her opinion; it will be easy for you,
        as you have the philosophy of the one and the wit of the other.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I thank you for the warning,&rdquo; said the count; &ldquo;I shall
        endeavor to be prepared for all suppositions.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You will, then, come on Saturday?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, since Madame de Morcerf invites me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are very kind.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Will M. Danglars be there?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He has already been invited by my father. We shall try to persuade the great
        d&rsquo;Aguesseau,<a href="#linknote-11" name="linknoteref-11" id="linknoteref-11">11</a> M.
        de Villefort, to come, but have not much hope of seeing him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Never despair of anything,&rsquo; says the proverb.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you dance, count?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I dance?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, you; it would not be astonishing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is very well before one is over forty. No, I do not dance, but
        I like to see others do so. Does Madame de Morcerf dance?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Never; you can talk to her, she so delights in your conversation.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30283m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, truly; and I assure you. You are the only man of whom I have
        heard her speak with interest.&rdquo; Albert rose and took his hat; the
        count conducted him to the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have one thing to reproach myself with,&rdquo; said he, stopping Albert
        on the steps. &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have spoken to you indiscreetly about Danglars.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On the contrary, speak to me always in the same strain about him.&rdquo;

      <p>
        &ldquo;I am glad to be reassured on that point. Apropos, when do you
        aspect M. d&rsquo;Épinay?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Five or six days hence at the latest.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And when is he to be married?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Immediately on the arrival of M. and Madame de Saint-Méran.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bring him to see me. Although you say I do not like him, I assure
        you I shall be happy to see him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will obey your orders, my lord.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Good-bye.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Until Saturday, when I may expect you, may I not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I promised you.&rdquo; The Count watched Albert, waving his
        hand to him. When he had mounted his phaeton, Monte Cristo turned, and
        seeing Bertuccio, &ldquo;What news?&rdquo; said he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;She went to the Palais,&rdquo; replied the steward.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did she stay long there?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;An hour and a half.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did she return home?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Directly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, my dear Bertuccio,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;I now advise
        you to go in quest of the little estate I spoke to you of in Normandy.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Bertuccio bowed, and as his wishes were in perfect harmony with the order
        he had received, he started the same evening.
