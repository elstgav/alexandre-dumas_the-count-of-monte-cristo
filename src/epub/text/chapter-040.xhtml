      <h2>Chapter 40. The Breakfast</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nd what sort of
        persons do you expect to breakfast?&rdquo; said Beauchamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A gentleman, and a diplomatist.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then we shall have to wait two hours for the gentleman, and three
        for the diplomatist. I shall come back to dessert; keep me some
        strawberries, coffee, and cigars. I shall take a cutlet on my way to the
        Chamber.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do not do anything of the sort; for were the gentleman a
        Montmorency, and the diplomatist a Metternich, we will breakfast at
        eleven; in the meantime, follow Debray&rsquo;s example, and take a glass
        of sherry and a biscuit.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Be it so; I will stay; I must do something to distract my thoughts.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are like Debray, and yet it seems to me that when the minister
        is out of spirits, the opposition ought to be joyous.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, you do not know with what I am threatened. I shall hear this
        morning that M. Danglars make a speech at the Chamber of Deputies, and at
        his wife&rsquo;s this evening I shall hear the tragedy of a peer of
        France. The devil take the constitutional government, and since we had our
        choice, as they say, at least, how could we choose that?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I understand; you must lay in a stock of hilarity.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do not run down M. Danglars&rsquo; speeches,&rdquo; said Debray;
        &ldquo;he votes for you, for he belongs to the opposition.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Pardieu</i>, that is exactly the worst of all. I am waiting
        until you send him to speak at the Luxembourg, to laugh at my ease.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear friend,&rdquo; said Albert to Beauchamp, &ldquo;it is plain
        that the affairs of Spain are settled, for you are most desperately out of
        humor this morning. Recollect that Parisian gossip has spoken of a
        marriage between myself and Mlle. Eugénie Danglars; I cannot in
        conscience, therefore, let you run down the speeches of a man who will one
        day say to me, &lsquo;Vicomte, you know I give my daughter two millions.&rsquo;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, this marriage will never take place,&rdquo; said Beauchamp.
        &ldquo;The king has made him a baron, and can make him a peer, but he
        cannot make him a gentleman, and the Count of Morcerf is too aristocratic
        to consent, for the paltry sum of two million francs, to a <i>mésalliance</i>.
        The Viscount of Morcerf can only wed a marchioness.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But two million francs make a nice little sum,&rdquo; replied
        Morcerf.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is the social capital of a theatre on the boulevard, or a
        railroad from the Jardin des Plantes to La Râpée.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Never mind what he says, Morcerf,&rdquo; said Debray, &ldquo;do you
        marry her. You marry a money-bag label, it is true; well, but what does
        that matter? It is better to have a blazon less and a figure more on it.
        You have seven martlets on your arms; give three to your wife, and you
        will still have four; that is one more than M. de Guise had, who so nearly
        became King of France, and whose cousin was Emperor of Germany.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On my word, I think you are right, Lucien,&rdquo; said Albert
        absently.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To be sure; besides, every millionaire is as noble as a bastard&mdash;that
        is, he can be.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do not say that, Debray,&rdquo; returned Beauchamp, laughing,
        &ldquo;for here is Château-Renaud, who, to cure you of your mania for
        paradoxes, will pass the sword of Renaud de Montauban, his ancestor,
        through your body.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He will sully it then,&rdquo; returned Lucien; &ldquo;for I am low&mdash;very
        low.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, heavens,&rdquo; cried Beauchamp, &ldquo;the minister quotes
        Béranger, what shall we come to next?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. de Château-Renaud&mdash;M. Maximilian Morrel,&rdquo; said the
        servant, announcing two fresh guests.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now, then, to breakfast,&rdquo; said Beauchamp; &ldquo;for, if I
        remember, you told me you only expected two persons, Albert.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Morrel,&rdquo; muttered Albert&mdash;&ldquo;Morrel&mdash;who is he?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        But before he had finished, M. de Château-Renaud, a handsome young man of
        thirty, gentleman all over,&mdash;that is, with the figure of a Guiche and
        the wit of a Mortemart,&mdash;took Albert&rsquo;s hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear Albert,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let me introduce to you M. Maximilian
        Morrel, captain of Spahis, my friend; and what is more&mdash;however the
        man speaks for himself&mdash;my preserver. Salute my hero, viscount.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And he stepped on one side to give place to a young man of refined and
        dignified bearing, with large and open brow, piercing eyes, and black
        moustache, whom our readers have already seen at Marseilles, under
        circumstances sufficiently dramatic not to be forgotten. A rich uniform,
        half French, half Oriental, set off his graceful and stalwart figure, and
        his broad chest was decorated with the order of the Legion of Honor. The
        young officer bowed with easy and elegant politeness.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said Albert with affectionate courtesy, &ldquo;the count
        of Château-Renaud knew how much pleasure this introduction would give me; you
        are his friend, be ours also.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well said,&rdquo; interrupted Château-Renaud; &ldquo;and pray that,
        if you should ever be in a similar predicament, he may do as much for you
        as he did for me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What has he done?&rdquo; asked Albert.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, nothing worth speaking of,&rdquo; said Morrel; &ldquo;M. de
        Château-Renaud exaggerates.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not worth speaking of?&rdquo; cried Château-Renaud; &ldquo;life is
        not worth speaking of!&mdash;that is rather too philosophical, on my word,
        Morrel. It is very well for you, who risk your life every day, but for me,
        who only did so once&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We gather from all this, baron, that Captain Morrel saved your
        life.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Exactly so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On what occasion?&rdquo; asked Beauchamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Beauchamp, my good fellow, you know I am starving,&rdquo; said
        Debray: &ldquo;do not set him off on some long story.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I do not prevent your sitting down to table,&rdquo; replied
        Beauchamp, &ldquo;Château-Renaud can tell us while we eat our breakfast.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Morcerf, &ldquo;it is only a quarter past
        ten, and I expect someone else.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, true, a diplomatist!&rdquo; observed Debray.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Diplomat or not, I don&rsquo;t know; I only know that he charged
        himself on my account with a mission, which he terminated so entirely to
        my satisfaction, that had I been king, I should have instantly created him
        knight of all my orders, even had I been able to offer him the Golden
        Fleece and the Garter.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, since we are not to sit down to table,&rdquo; said Debray,
        &ldquo;take a glass of sherry, and tell us all about it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You all know that I had the fancy of going to Africa.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is a road your ancestors have traced for you,&rdquo; said Albert
        gallantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes? but I doubt that your object was like theirs&mdash;to rescue
        the Holy Sepulchre.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are quite right, Beauchamp,&rdquo; observed the young
        aristocrat. &ldquo;It was only to fight as an amateur. I cannot bear
        duelling ever since two seconds, whom I had chosen to arrange an affair,
        forced me to break the arm of one of my best friends, one whom you all
        know&mdash;poor Franz d&rsquo;Épinay.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, true,&rdquo; said Debray, &ldquo;you did fight some time ago;
        about what?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20235m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The devil take me, if I remember,&rdquo; returned Château-Renaud.
        &ldquo;But I recollect perfectly one thing, that, being unwilling to let
        such talents as mine sleep, I wished to try upon the Arabs the new pistols
        that had been given to me. In consequence I embarked for Oran, and went
        from thence to Constantine, where I arrived just in time to witness the
        raising of the siege. I retreated with the rest, for eight-and-forty
        hours. I endured the rain during the day, and the cold during the night
        tolerably well, but the third morning my horse died of cold. Poor brute&mdash;accustomed
        to be covered up and to have a stove in the stable, the Arabian finds
        himself unable to bear ten degrees of cold in Arabia.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s why you want to purchase my English horse,&rdquo; said
        Debray, &ldquo;you think he will bear the cold better.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are mistaken, for I have made a vow never to return to Africa.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You were very much frightened, then?&rdquo; asked Beauchamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, yes, and I had good reason to be so,&rdquo; replied
        Château-Renaud. &ldquo;I was retreating on foot, for my horse was dead.
        Six Arabs came up, full gallop, to cut off my head. I shot two with my
        double-barrelled gun, and two more with my pistols, but I was then
        disarmed, and two were still left; one seized me by the hair (that is why
        I now wear it so short, for no one knows what may happen), the other swung
        a yataghan, and I already felt the cold steel on my neck, when this
        gentleman whom you see here charged them, shot the one who held me by the
        hair, and cleft the skull of the other with his sabre. He had assigned
        himself the task of saving a man&rsquo;s life that day; chance caused that
        man to be myself. When I am rich I will order a statue of Chance from
        Klagmann or Marochetti.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Morrel, smiling, &ldquo;it was the 5th of
        September, the anniversary of the day on which my father was miraculously
        preserved; therefore, as far as it lies in my power, I endeavor to
        celebrate it by some&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20237m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Heroic action,&rdquo; interrupted Château-Renaud. &ldquo;I was
        chosen. But that is not all&mdash;after rescuing me from the sword, he
        rescued me from the cold, not by sharing his cloak with me, like St.
        Martin, but by giving me the whole; then from hunger by sharing with me&mdash;guess
        what?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A Strasbourg pie?&rdquo; asked Beauchamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, his horse; of which we each of us ate a slice with a hearty
        appetite. It was very hard.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The horse?&rdquo; said Morcerf, laughing.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, the sacrifice,&rdquo; returned Château-Renaud; &ldquo;ask
        Debray if he would sacrifice his English steed for a stranger?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not for a stranger,&rdquo; said Debray, &ldquo;but for a friend I
        might, perhaps.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I divined that you would become mine, count,&rdquo; replied Morrel;
        &ldquo;besides, as I had the honor to tell you, heroism or not, sacrifice
        or not, that day I owed an offering to bad fortune in recompense for the
        favors good fortune had on other days granted to us.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The history to which M. Morrel alludes,&rdquo; continued
        Château-Renaud, &ldquo;is an admirable one, which he will tell you some
        day when you are better acquainted with him; today let us fill our
        stomachs, and not our memories. What time do you breakfast, Albert?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At half-past ten.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Precisely?&rdquo; asked Debray, taking out his watch.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, you will give me five minutes&rsquo; grace,&rdquo; replied
        Morcerf, &ldquo;for I also expect a preserver.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of whom?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of myself,&rdquo; cried Morcerf; &ldquo;<i>parbleu!</i> do you
        think I cannot be saved as well as anyone else, and that there are only
        Arabs who cut off heads? Our breakfast is a philanthropic one, and we
        shall have at table&mdash;at least, I hope so&mdash;two benefactors of
        humanity.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; said Debray; &ldquo;we have only one
        Monthyon prize.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, it will be given to someone who has done nothing to deserve
        it,&rdquo; said Beauchamp; &ldquo;that is the way the Academy mostly
        escapes from the dilemma.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And where does he come from?&rdquo; asked Debray. &ldquo;You have
        already answered the question once, but so vaguely that I venture to put
        it a second time.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said Albert, &ldquo;I do not know; when I invited
        him three months ago, he was then at Rome, but since that time who knows
        where he may have gone?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you think him capable of being exact?&rdquo; demanded Debray.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I think him capable of everything.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, with the five minutes&rsquo; grace, we have only ten left.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will profit by them to tell you something about my guest.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo; interrupted Beauchamp; &ldquo;are there any
        materials for an article in what you are going to tell us?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, and for a most curious one.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Go on, then, for I see I shall not get to the Chamber this morning,
        and I must make up for it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I was at Rome during the last Carnival.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We know that,&rdquo; said Beauchamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, but what you do not know is that I was carried off by bandits.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There are no bandits,&rdquo; cried Debray.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes there are, and most hideous, or rather most admirable ones, for
        I found them ugly enough to frighten me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, my dear Albert,&rdquo; said Debray, &ldquo;confess that your
        cook is behindhand, that the oysters have not arrived from Ostend or
        Marennes, and that, like Madame de Maintenon, you are going to replace the
        dish by a story. Say so at once; we are sufficiently well-bred to excuse
        you, and to listen to your history, fabulous as it promises to be.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And I say to you, fabulous as it may seem, I tell it as a true one
        from beginning to end. The brigands had carried me off, and conducted me
        to a gloomy spot, called the Catacombs of Saint Sebastian.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; said Château-Renaud; &ldquo;I narrowly escaped
        catching a fever there.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And I did more than that,&rdquo; replied Morcerf, &ldquo;for I
        caught one. I was informed that I was prisoner until I paid the sum of
        4,000 Roman crowns&mdash;about 24,000 francs. Unfortunately, I had not
        above 1,500. I was at the end of my journey and of my credit. I wrote to
        Franz&mdash;and were he here he would confirm every word&mdash;I wrote
        then to Franz that if he did not come with the four thousand crowns before
        six, at ten minutes past I should have gone to join the blessed saints and
        glorious martyrs in whose company I had the honor of being; and Signor
        Luigi Vampa, such was the name of the chief of these bandits, would have
        scrupulously kept his word.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But Franz did come with the four thousand crowns,&rdquo; said
        Château-Renaud. &ldquo;A man whose name is Franz d&rsquo;Épinay or Albert
        de Morcerf has not much difficulty in procuring them.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, he arrived accompanied simply by the guest I am going to
        present to you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, this gentleman is a Hercules killing Cacus, a Perseus freeing
        Andromeda.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, he is a man about my own size.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Armed to the teeth?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He had not even a knitting-needle.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But he paid your ransom?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He said two words to the chief and I was free.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And they apologized to him for having carried you off?&rdquo; said
        Beauchamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Just so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, he is a second Ariosto.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, his name is the Count of Monte Cristo.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There is no Count of Monte Cristo&rdquo; said Debray.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not think so,&rdquo; added Château-Renaud, with the air of a
        man who knows the whole of the European nobility perfectly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Does anyone know anything of a Count of Monte Cristo?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He comes possibly from the Holy Land, and one of his ancestors
        possessed Calvary, as the Mortemarts did the Dead Sea.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I think I can assist your researches,&rdquo; said Maximilian.
        &ldquo;Monte Cristo is a little island I have often heard spoken of by the
        old sailors my father employed&mdash;a grain of sand in the centre of the
        Mediterranean, an atom in the infinite.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Precisely!&rdquo; cried Albert. &ldquo;Well, he of whom I speak is
        the lord and master of this grain of sand, of this atom; he has purchased
        the title of count somewhere in Tuscany.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is rich, then?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I believe so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But that ought to be visible.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is what deceives you, Debray.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not understand you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you read the <i>Arabian Nights</i>?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What a question!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, do you know if the persons you see there are rich or poor, if
        their sacks of wheat are not rubies or diamonds? They seem like poor
        fishermen, and suddenly they open some mysterious cavern filled with the
        wealth of the Indies.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Which means?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Which means that my Count of Monte Cristo is one of those
        fishermen. He has even a name taken from the book, since he calls himself
        Sinbad the Sailor, and has a cave filled with gold.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you have seen this cavern, Morcerf?&rdquo; asked Beauchamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, but Franz has; for heaven&rsquo;s sake, not a word of this
        before him. Franz went in with his eyes blindfolded, and was waited on by
        mutes and by women to whom Cleopatra was a painted strumpet. Only he is
        not quite sure about the women, for they did not come in until after he
        had taken hashish, so that what he took for women might have been simply a
        row of statues.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The two young men looked at Morcerf as if to say,&mdash;&ldquo;Are you
        mad, or are you laughing at us?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And I also,&rdquo; said Morrel thoughtfully, &ldquo;have heard
        something like this from an old sailor named Penelon.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; cried Albert, &ldquo;it is very lucky that M. Morrel
        comes to aid me; you are vexed, are you not, that he thus gives a clew to
        the labyrinth?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear Albert,&rdquo; said Debray, &ldquo;what you tell us is so
        extraordinary.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, because your ambassadors and your consuls do not tell you of
        them&mdash;they have no time. They are too much taken up with interfering
        in the affairs of their countrymen who travel.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now you get angry, and attack our poor agents. How will you have
        them protect you? The Chamber cuts down their salaries every day, so that
        now they have scarcely any. Will you be ambassador, Albert? I will send
        you to Constantinople.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, lest on the first demonstration I make in favor of Mehemet Ali,
        the Sultan send me the bowstring, and make my secretaries strangle me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You say very true,&rdquo; responded Debray.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Albert, &ldquo;but this has nothing to do with the
        existence of the Count of Monte Cristo.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Pardieu!</i> everyone exists.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Doubtless, but not in the same way; everyone has not black slaves,
        a princely retinue, an arsenal of weapons that would do credit to an
        Arabian fortress, horses that cost six thousand francs apiece, and Greek
        mistresses.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you seen the Greek mistress?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have both seen and heard her. I saw her at the theatre, and heard
        her one morning when I breakfasted with the count.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He eats, then?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; but so little, it can hardly be called eating.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He must be a vampire.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Laugh, if you will; the Countess G&mdash;&mdash;, who knew Lord
        Ruthven, declared that the count was a vampire.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, capital,&rdquo; said Beauchamp. &ldquo;For a man not connected
        with newspapers, here is the pendant to the famous sea-serpent of the <i>Constitutionnel</i>.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Wild eyes, the iris of which contracts or dilates at pleasure,&rdquo;
        said Debray; &ldquo;facial angle strongly developed, magnificent forehead,
        livid complexion, black beard, sharp and white teeth, politeness
        unexceptionable.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Just so, Lucien,&rdquo; returned Morcerf; &ldquo;you have described
        him feature for feature. Yes, keen and cutting politeness. This man has
        often made me shudder; and one day when we were viewing an execution, I
        thought I should faint, more from hearing the cold and calm manner in
        which he spoke of every description of torture, than from the sight of the
        executioner and the culprit.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did he not conduct you to the ruins of the Colosseum and suck your
        blood?&rdquo; asked Beauchamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Or, having delivered you, make you sign a flaming parchment,
        surrendering your soul to him as Esau did his birth-right?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Rail on, rail on at your ease, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Morcerf,
        somewhat piqued. &ldquo;When I look at you Parisians, idlers on the
        Boulevard de Gand or the Bois de Boulogne, and think of this man, it seems
        to me we are not of the same race.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am highly flattered,&rdquo; returned Beauchamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At the same time,&rdquo; added Château-Renaud, &ldquo;your Count of
        Monte Cristo is a very fine fellow, always excepting his little
        arrangements with the Italian banditti.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;There are no Italian banditti,&rdquo; said Debray.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No vampire,&rdquo; cried Beauchamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No Count of Monte Cristo&rdquo; added Debray. &ldquo;There is
        half-past ten striking, Albert.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20243m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Confess you have dreamed this, and let us sit down to breakfast,&rdquo;
        continued Beauchamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the sound of the clock had not died away when Germain announced, &ldquo;His
        excellency the Count of Monte Cristo.&rdquo; The involuntary start everyone gave
        proved how much Morcerf&rsquo;s narrative had impressed them, and Albert himself
        could not wholly refrain from manifesting sudden emotion. He had not heard a
        carriage stop in the street, or steps in the antechamber; the door had itself
        opened noiselessly. The count appeared, dressed with the greatest simplicity, but
        the most fastidious dandy could have found nothing to cavil at in his
        toilet. Every article of dress&mdash;hat, coat, gloves, and boots&mdash;was
        from the first makers. He seemed scarcely five-and-thirty. But what struck
        everybody was his extreme resemblance to the portrait Debray had drawn.
        The count advanced, smiling, into the centre of the room, and approached
        Albert, who hastened towards him holding out his hand in a ceremonial manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Punctuality,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, &ldquo;is the
        politeness of kings, according to one of your sovereigns, I think; but it
        is not the same with travellers. However, I hope you will excuse the two
        or three seconds I am behindhand; five hundred leagues are not to be
        accomplished without some trouble, and especially in France, where, it
        seems, it is forbidden to beat the postilions.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear count,&rdquo; replied Albert, &ldquo;I was announcing your
        visit to some of my friends, whom I had invited in consequence of the
        promise you did me the honor to make, and whom I now present to you. They
        are the Count of Château-Renaud, whose nobility goes back to the twelve
        peers, and whose ancestors had a place at the Round Table; M. Lucien
        Debray, private secretary to the minister of the interior; M. Beauchamp,
        an editor of a paper, and the terror of the French government, but of
        whom, in spite of his national celebrity, you perhaps have not heard in
        Italy, since his paper is prohibited there; and M. Maximilian Morrel,
        captain of Spahis.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At this name the count, who had hitherto saluted everyone with courtesy,
        but at the same time with coldness and formality, stepped a pace forward,
        and a slight tinge of red colored his pale cheeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You wear the uniform of the new French conquerors, monsieur,&rdquo; said
        he; &ldquo;it is a handsome uniform.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        No one could have said what caused the count&rsquo;s voice to vibrate so deeply,
        and what made his eye flash, which was in general so clear, lustrous, and limpid
        when he pleased.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have never seen our Africans, count?&rdquo; said Albert.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Never,&rdquo; replied the count, who was by this time perfectly master of
        himself again.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, beneath this uniform beats one of the bravest and noblest
        hearts in the whole army.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, M. de Morcerf,&rdquo; interrupted Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let me go on, captain. And we have just heard,&rdquo; continued
        Albert, &ldquo;of a new deed of his, and so heroic a one, that, although I
        have seen him today for the first time, I request you to allow me to
        introduce him as my friend.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At these words it was still possible to observe in Monte Cristo the concentrated
        look, changing color, and slight trembling of the eyelid that show emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, you have a noble heart,&rdquo; said the count; &ldquo;so much the
        better.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        This
        exclamation, which corresponded to the count&rsquo;s own thought rather
        than to what Albert was saying, surprised everybody, and especially
        Morrel, who looked at Monte Cristo with wonder. But, at the same time, the
        intonation was so soft that, however strange the speech might seem, it was
        impossible to be offended at it.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20245m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why should he doubt it?&rdquo; said Beauchamp to Château-Renaud.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In reality,&rdquo; replied the latter, who, with his aristocratic
        glance and his knowledge of the world, had penetrated at once all that was
        penetrable in Monte Cristo, &ldquo;Albert has not deceived us, for the
        count is a most singular being. What say you, Morrel!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Ma foi</i>, he has an open look about him that pleases me, in
        spite of the singular remark he has made about me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said Albert, &ldquo;Germain informs me that
        breakfast is ready. My dear count, allow me to show you the way.&rdquo;
        They passed silently into the breakfast-room, and everyone took his place.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said the count, seating himself, &ldquo;permit me
        to make a confession which must form my excuse for any improprieties I may
        commit. I am a stranger, and a stranger to such a degree, that this is the
        first time I have ever been at Paris. The French way of living is utterly
        unknown to me, and up to the present time I have followed the Eastern
        customs, which are entirely in contrast to the Parisian. I beg you,
        therefore, to excuse if you find anything in me too Turkish, too Italian,
        or too Arabian. Now, then, let us breakfast.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With what an air he says all this,&rdquo; muttered Beauchamp;
        &ldquo;decidedly he is a great man.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A great man in his own country,&rdquo; added Debray.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A great man in every country, M. Debray,&rdquo; said Château-Renaud.
      </p>
      <p>
        The count was, it may be remembered, a most temperate
        guest. Albert remarked this, expressing his fears lest, at the outset, the
        Parisian mode of life should displease the traveller in the most essential point.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear count,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I fear one thing, and
        that is, that the fare of the Rue du Helder is not so much to your taste
        as that of the Piazza di Spagna. I ought to have consulted you on the
        point, and have had some dishes prepared expressly.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Did you know me better,&rdquo; returned the count, smiling, &ldquo;you
        would not give one thought of such a thing for a traveller like myself,
        who has successively lived on macaroni at Naples, polenta at Milan, olla
        podrida at Valencia, pilau at Constantinople, curry in India, and swallows&rsquo;
        nests in China. I eat everywhere, and of everything, only I eat but
        little; and today, that you reproach me with my want of appetite, is my
        day of appetite, for I have not eaten since yesterday morning.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What,&rdquo; cried all the guests, &ldquo;you have not eaten for
        four-and-twenty hours?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the count; &ldquo;I was forced to go out of my
        road to obtain some information near Nîmes, so that I was somewhat late,
        and therefore I did not choose to stop.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you ate in your carriage?&rdquo; asked Morcerf.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I slept, as I generally do when I am weary without having the
        courage to amuse myself, or when I am hungry without feeling inclined to
        eat.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But you can sleep when you please, monsieur?&rdquo; said Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have a recipe for it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;An infallible one.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That would be invaluable to us in Africa, who have not always any
        food to eat, and rarely anything to drink.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo; &ldquo;but, unfortunately, a recipe
        excellent for a man like myself would be very dangerous applied to an
        army, which might not awake when it was needed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;May we inquire what is this recipe?&rdquo; asked Debray.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; returned Monte Cristo; &ldquo;I make no secret of
        it. It is a mixture of excellent opium, which I fetched myself from Canton
        in order to have it pure, and the best hashish which grows in the East&mdash;that
        is, between the Tigris and the Euphrates. These two ingredients are mixed
        in equal proportions, and formed into pills. Ten minutes after one is
        taken, the effect is produced. Ask Baron Franz d&rsquo;Épinay; I think he
        tasted them one day.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Morcerf, &ldquo;he said something about it to
        me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Beauchamp, who, as became a journalist, was very
        incredulous, &ldquo;you always carry this drug about you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Always.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Would it be an indiscretion to ask to see those precious pills?&rdquo;
        continued Beauchamp, hoping to take him at a disadvantage.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, monsieur,&rdquo; returned the count; and he drew from his
        pocket a marvellous casket, formed out of a single emerald and closed by a
        golden lid which unscrewed and gave passage to a small greenish colored
        pellet about the size of a pea. This ball had an acrid and penetrating
        odor. There were four or five more in the emerald, which would contain
        about a dozen. The casket passed around the table, but it was more to
        examine the admirable emerald than to see the pills that it passed from
        hand to hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And is it your cook who prepares these pills?&rdquo; asked Beauchamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, monsieur,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo; &ldquo;I do not thus
        betray my enjoyments to the vulgar. I am a tolerable chemist, and prepare
        my pills myself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This is a magnificent emerald, and the largest I have ever seen,&rdquo;
        said Château-Renaud, &ldquo;although my mother has some remarkable family
        jewels.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I had three similar ones,&rdquo; returned Monte Cristo. &ldquo;I
        gave one to the Sultan, who mounted it in his sabre; another to our holy
        father the Pope, who had it set in his tiara, opposite to one nearly as
        large, though not so fine, given by the Emperor Napoleon to his
        predecessor, Pius VII. I kept the third for myself, and I had it hollowed
        out, which reduced its value, but rendered it more commodious for the
        purpose I intended.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone looked at Monte Cristo with astonishment; he spoke with so much simplicity
        that it was evident he spoke the truth, or that he was mad. However, the sight of
        the emerald made them naturally incline to the former belief.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what did these two sovereigns give you in exchange for these
        magnificent presents?&rdquo; asked Debray.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The Sultan, the liberty of a woman,&rdquo; replied the Count;
        &ldquo;the Pope, the life of a man; so that once in my life I have been as
        powerful as if heaven had brought me into the world on the steps of a
        throne.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And it was Peppino you saved, was it not?&rdquo; cried Morcerf;
        &ldquo;it was for him that you obtained pardon?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; returned the count, smiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear count, you have no idea what pleasure it gives me to hear
        you speak thus,&rdquo; said Morcerf. &ldquo;I had announced you beforehand
        to my friends as an enchanter of the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, a wizard of
        the Middle Ages; but the Parisians are so subtle in paradoxes that they
        mistake for caprices of the imagination the most incontestable truths,
        when these truths do not form a part of their daily existence. For
        example, here is Debray who reads, and Beauchamp who prints, every day,
        &lsquo;A member of the Jockey Club has been stopped and robbed on the
        Boulevard;&rsquo; &lsquo;four persons have been assassinated in the Rue
        St. Denis&rsquo; or &lsquo;the Faubourg St. Germain;&rsquo; &lsquo;ten,
        fifteen, or twenty thieves, have been arrested in a <i>café</i> on the
        Boulevard du Temple, or in the Thermes de Julien,&rsquo;&mdash;and yet
        these same men deny the existence of the bandits in the Maremma, the
        Campagna di Romana, or the Pontine Marshes. Tell them yourself that I was
        taken by bandits, and that without your generous intercession I should now
        have been sleeping in the Catacombs of St. Sebastian, instead of receiving
        them in my humble abode in the Rue du Helder.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo &ldquo;you promised me never to
        mention that circumstance.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It was not I who made that promise,&rdquo; cried Morcerf; &ldquo;it
        must have been someone else whom you have rescued in the same manner, and
        whom you have forgotten. Pray speak of it, for I shall not only, I trust,
        relate the little I do know, but also a great deal I do not know.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; returned the count, smiling, &ldquo;that you
        played a sufficiently important part to know as well as myself what
        happened.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20249m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, you promise me, if I tell all I know, to relate, in your
        turn, all that I do not know?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is but fair,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Morcerf, &ldquo;for three days I believed myself
        the object of the attentions of a masque, whom I took for a descendant of
        Tullia or Poppæa, while I was simply the object of the attentions of a <i>contadina</i>,
        and I say <i>contadina</i> to avoid saying peasant girl. What I know is,
        that, like a fool, a greater fool than he of whom I spoke just now, I
        mistook for this peasant girl a young bandit of fifteen or sixteen, with a
        beardless chin and slim waist, and who, just as I was about to imprint a
        chaste salute on his lips, placed a pistol to my head, and, aided by seven
        or eight others, led, or rather dragged me, to the Catacombs of St.
        Sebastian, where I found a highly educated brigand chief perusing Cæsar&rsquo;s
        <i>Commentaries</i>, and who deigned to leave off reading to inform me,
        that unless the next morning, before six o&rsquo;clock, four thousand
        piastres were paid into his account at his banker&rsquo;s, at a quarter
        past six I should have ceased to exist. The letter is still to be seen,
        for it is in Franz d&rsquo;Épinay&rsquo;s possession, signed by me, and
        with a postscript of M. Luigi Vampa. This is all I know, but I know not,
        count, how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of Rome
        who ordinarily have so little respect for anything. I assure you, Franz
        and I were lost in admiration.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing more simple,&rdquo; returned the count. &ldquo;I had known
        the famous Vampa for more than ten years. When he was quite a child, and
        only a shepherd, I gave him a few gold pieces for showing me my way, and
        he, in order to repay me, gave me a poniard, the hilt of which he had
        carved with his own hand, and which you may have seen in my collection of
        arms. In after years, whether he had forgotten this interchange of
        presents, which ought to have cemented our friendship, or whether he did
        not recollect me, he sought to take me, but, on the contrary, it was I who
        captured him and a dozen of his band. I might have handed him over to
        Roman justice, which is somewhat expeditious, and which would have been
        particularly so with him; but I did nothing of the sort&mdash;I suffered
        him and his band to depart.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With the condition that they should sin no more,&rdquo; said
        Beauchamp, laughing. &ldquo;I see they kept their promise.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, monsieur,&rdquo; returned Monte Cristo &ldquo;upon the simple
        condition that they should respect myself and my friends. Perhaps what I
        am about to say may seem strange to you, who are socialists, and vaunt
        humanity and your duty to your neighbor, but I never seek to protect a
        society which does not protect me, and which I will even say, generally
        occupies itself about me only to injure me; and thus by giving them a low
        place in my esteem, and preserving a neutrality towards them, it is
        society and my neighbor who are indebted to me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bravo,&rdquo; cried Château-Renaud; &ldquo;you are the first man I
        ever met sufficiently courageous to preach egotism. Bravo, count, bravo!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is frank, at least,&rdquo; said Morrel. &ldquo;But I am sure
        that the count does not regret having once deviated from the principles he
        has so boldly avowed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How have I deviated from those principles, monsieur?&rdquo; asked
        Monte Cristo, who could not help looking at Morrel with so much intensity,
        that two or three times the young man had been unable to sustain that
        clear and piercing glance.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, it seems to me,&rdquo; replied Morrel, &ldquo;that in
        delivering M. de Morcerf, whom you did not know, you did good to your
        neighbor and to society.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Of which he is the brightest ornament,&rdquo; said Beauchamp,
        drinking off a glass of champagne.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear count,&rdquo; cried Morcerf, &ldquo;you are at fault&mdash;you,
        one of the most formidable logicians I know&mdash;and you must see it
        clearly proved that instead of being an egotist, you are a philanthropist.
        Ah, you call yourself Oriental, a Levantine, Maltese, Indian, Chinese;
        your family name is Monte Cristo; Sinbad the Sailor is your baptismal
        appellation, and yet the first day you set foot in Paris you instinctively
        display the greatest virtue, or rather the chief defect, of us eccentric
        Parisians,&mdash;that is, you assume the vices you have not, and conceal
        the virtues you possess.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear vicomte,&rdquo; returned Monte Cristo, &ldquo;I do not see,
        in all I have done, anything that merits, either from you or these
        gentlemen, the pretended eulogies I have received. You were no stranger to
        me, for I knew you from the time I gave up two rooms to you, invited you
        to breakfast with me, lent you one of my carriages, witnessed the Carnival
        in your company, and saw with you from a window in the Piazza del Popolo
        the execution that affected you so much that you nearly fainted. I will
        appeal to any of these gentlemen, could I leave my guest in the hands of a
        hideous bandit, as you term him? Besides, you know, I had the idea that
        you could introduce me into some of the Paris salons when I came to
        France. You might some time ago have looked upon this resolution as a
        vague project, but today you see it was a reality, and you must submit to
        it under penalty of breaking your word.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will keep it,&rdquo; returned Morcerf; &ldquo;but I fear that you
        will be much disappointed, accustomed as you are to picturesque events and
        fantastic horizons. Amongst us you will not meet with any of those
        episodes with which your adventurous existence has so familiarized you;
        our Chimborazo is Mortmartre, our Himalaya is Mount Valérien, our Great
        Desert is the plain of Grenelle, where they are now boring an artesian
        well to water the caravans. We have plenty of thieves, though not so many
        as is said; but these thieves stand in far more dread of a policeman than
        a lord. France is so prosaic, and Paris so civilized a city, that you will
        not find in its eighty-five departments&mdash;I say eighty-five, because I
        do not include Corsica&mdash;you will not find, then, in these eighty-five
        departments a single hill on which there is not a telegraph, or a grotto
        in which the commissary of police has not put up a gaslamp. There is but
        one service I can render you, and for that I place myself entirely at your
        orders, that is, to present, or make my friends present, you everywhere;
        besides, you have no need of anyone to introduce you&mdash;with your name,
        and your fortune, and your talent&rdquo; (Monte Cristo bowed with a
        somewhat ironical smile) &ldquo;you can present yourself everywhere, and
        be well received. I can be useful in one way only&mdash;if knowledge of
        Parisian habits, of the means of rendering yourself comfortable, or of the
        bazaars, can assist, you may depend upon me to find you a fitting dwelling
        here. I do not dare offer to share my apartments with you, as I shared
        yours at Rome&mdash;I, who do not profess egotism, but am yet egotist <i>par
        excellence</i>; for, except myself, these rooms would not hold a shadow
        more, unless that shadow were feminine.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;that is a most conjugal
        reservation; I recollect that at Rome you said something of a projected
        marriage. May I congratulate you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The affair is still in projection.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And he who says in &lsquo;projection,&rsquo; means already decided,&rdquo;
        said Debray.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Morcerf, &ldquo;my father is most anxious about
        it; and I hope, ere long, to introduce you, if not to my wife, at least to
        my betrothed&mdash;Mademoiselle Eugénie Danglars.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Eugénie Danglars,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo; &ldquo;tell me, is not
        her father Baron Danglars?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Morcerf, &ldquo;a baron of a new creation.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What matter,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo &ldquo;if he has rendered the
        State services which merit this distinction?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Enormous ones,&rdquo; answered Beauchamp. &ldquo;Although in
        reality a Liberal, he negotiated a loan of six millions for Charles X., in
        1829, who made him a baron and chevalier of the Legion of Honor; so that
        he wears the ribbon, not, as you would think, in his waistcoat-pocket, but
        at his button-hole.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; interrupted Morcerf, laughing, &ldquo;Beauchamp,
        Beauchamp, keep that for the <i>Corsaire</i> or the <i>Charivari</i>, but
        spare my future father-in-law before me.&rdquo; Then, turning to Monte
        Cristo, &ldquo;You just now spoke his name as if you knew the baron?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not know him,&rdquo; returned Monte Cristo; &ldquo;but I shall
        probably soon make his acquaintance, for I have a credit opened with him
        by the house of Richard &amp; Blount, of London, Arstein &amp; Eskeles of
        Vienna, and Thomson &amp; French at Rome.&rdquo; As he pronounced the two
        last names, the count glanced at Maximilian Morrel. If the stranger
        expected to produce an effect on Morrel, he was not mistaken&mdash;Maximilian
        started as if he had been electrified.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thomson &amp; French,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;do you know this house,
        monsieur?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20253m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They are my bankers in the capital of the Christian world,&rdquo;
        returned the count quietly. &ldquo;Can my influence with them be of any
        service to you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, count, you could assist me perhaps in researches which have
        been, up to the present, fruitless. This house, in past years, did ours a
        great service, and has, I know not for what reason, always denied having
        rendered us this service.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall be at your orders,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo bowing.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued Morcerf, &ldquo;<i>à propos</i> of Danglars,&mdash;we
        have strangely wandered from the subject. We were speaking of a suitable
        habitation for the Count of Monte Cristo. Come, gentlemen, let us all
        propose some place. Where shall we lodge this new guest in our great
        capital?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Faubourg Saint-Germain,&rdquo; said Château-Renaud. &ldquo;The
        count will find there a charming hotel, with a court and garden.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bah! Château-Renaud,&rdquo; returned Debray, &ldquo;you only know
        your dull and gloomy Faubourg Saint-Germain; do not pay any attention to
        him, count&mdash;live in the Chaussée d&rsquo;Antin, that&rsquo;s the real
        centre of Paris.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Boulevard de l&rsquo;Opéra,&rdquo; said Beauchamp; &ldquo;the
        second floor&mdash;a house with a balcony. The count will have his
        cushions of silver cloth brought there, and as he smokes his chibouque,
        see all Paris pass before him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have no idea, then, Morrel?&rdquo; asked Château-Renaud;
        &ldquo;you do not propose anything.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; returned the young man, smiling; &ldquo;on the
        contrary, I have one, but I expected the count would be tempted by one of
        the brilliant proposals made him, yet as he has not replied to any of
        them, I will venture to offer him a suite of apartments in a charming
        hotel, in the Pompadour style, that my sister has inhabited for a year, in
        the Rue Meslay.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have a sister?&rdquo; asked the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, monsieur, a most excellent sister.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Married?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nearly nine years.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Happy?&rdquo; asked the count again.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;As happy as it is permitted to a human creature to be,&rdquo;
        replied Maximilian. &ldquo;She married the man she loved, who remained
        faithful to us in our fallen fortunes&mdash;Emmanuel Herbaut.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo smiled imperceptibly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I live there during my leave of absence,&rdquo; continued Maximilian;
        &ldquo;and I shall be, together with my brother-in-law Emmanuel, at the disposition
        of the Count, whenever he thinks fit to honor us.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;One minute,&rdquo; cried Albert, without giving Monte Cristo the
        time to reply. &ldquo;Take care, you are going to immure a traveller,
        Sinbad the Sailor, a man who comes to see Paris; you are going to make a
        patriarch of him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/20255m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; said Morrel; &ldquo;my sister is five-and-twenty, my
        brother-in-law is thirty, they are gay, young, and happy. Besides, the
        count will be in his own house, and only see them when he thinks fit to do
        so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thanks, monsieur,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo; &ldquo;I shall content
        myself with being presented to your sister and her husband, if you will do
        me the honor to introduce me; but I cannot accept the offer of anyone of
        these gentlemen, since my habitation is already prepared.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What,&rdquo; cried Morcerf; &ldquo;you are, then, going to a hotel&mdash;that
        will be very dull for you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Was I so badly lodged at Rome?&rdquo; said Monte Cristo smiling.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Parbleu!</i> at Rome you spent fifty thousand piastres in
        furnishing your apartments, but I presume that you are not disposed to
        spend a similar sum every day.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is not that which deterred me,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo;
        &ldquo;but as I determined to have a house to myself, I sent on my valet
        de chambre, and he ought by this time to have bought the house and
        furnished it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But you have, then, a valet de chambre who knows Paris?&rdquo; said
        Beauchamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is the first time he has ever been in Paris. He is black, and
        cannot speak,&rdquo; returned Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is Ali!&rdquo; cried Albert, in the midst of the general
        surprise.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, Ali himself, my Nubian mute, whom you saw, I think, at Rome.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Morcerf; &ldquo;I recollect him perfectly.
        But how could you charge a Nubian to purchase a house, and a mute to
        furnish it?&mdash;he will do everything wrong.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Undeceive yourself, monsieur,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo; &ldquo;I
        am quite sure, that, on the contrary, he will choose everything as I wish.
        He knows my tastes, my caprices, my wants. He has been here a week, with
        the instinct of a hound, hunting by himself. He will arrange everything
        for me. He knew, that I should arrive today at ten o&rsquo;clock; he was
        waiting for me at nine at the Barrière de Fontainebleau. He gave me this
        paper; it contains the number of my new abode; read it yourself,&rdquo;
        and Monte Cristo passed a paper to Albert.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, that is really original,&rdquo; said Beauchamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And very princely,&rdquo; added Château-Renaud.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What, do you not know your house?&rdquo; asked Debray.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo; &ldquo;I told you I did not wish to
        be behind my time; I dressed myself in the carriage, and descended at the
        viscount&rsquo;s door.&rdquo; The young men looked at each other; they did
        not know if it was a comedy Monte Cristo was playing, but every word he
        uttered had such an air of simplicity, that it was impossible to suppose
        what he said was false&mdash;besides, why should he tell a falsehood?
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We must content ourselves, then,&rdquo; said Beauchamp, &ldquo;with
        rendering the count all the little services in our power. I, in my quality
        of journalist, open all the theatres to him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Thanks, monsieur,&rdquo; returned Monte Cristo, &ldquo;my steward
        has orders to take a box at each theatre.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is your steward also a Nubian?&rdquo; asked Debray.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, he is a countryman of yours, if a Corsican is a countryman of
        anyone&rsquo;s. But you know him, M. de Morcerf.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is it that excellent M. Bertuccio, who understands hiring windows
        so well?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, you saw him the day I had the honor of receiving you; he has
        been a soldier, a smuggler&mdash;in fact, everything. I would not be quite
        sure that he has not been mixed up with the police for some trifle&mdash;a
        stab with a knife, for instance.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you have chosen this honest citizen for your steward,&rdquo;
        said Debray. &ldquo;Of how much does he rob you every year?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On my word,&rdquo; replied the count, &ldquo;not more than another.
        I am sure he answers my purpose, knows no impossibility, and so I keep
        him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; continued Château-Renaud, &ldquo;since you have an
        establishment, a steward, and a hotel in the Champs-Élysées, you only want
        a mistress.&rdquo; Albert smiled. He thought of the fair Greek he had seen
        in the count&rsquo;s box at the Argentina and Valle theatres.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have something better than that,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo; &ldquo;I have
        a slave. You procure your mistresses from the opera, the Vaudeville, or the
        Variétés; I purchased mine at Constantinople; it cost me more, but I have
        nothing to fear.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But you forget,&rdquo; replied Debray, laughing, &ldquo;that we are
        Franks by name and franks by nature, as King Charles said, and that the
        moment she puts her foot in France your slave becomes free.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Who will tell her?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The first person who sees her.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;She only speaks Romaic.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That is different.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But at least we shall see her,&rdquo; said Beauchamp, &ldquo;or do
        you keep eunuchs as well as mutes?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo; &ldquo;I do not carry
        brutalism so far. Everyone who surrounds me is free to quit me, and when
        they leave me will no longer have any need of me or anyone else; it is for
        that reason, perhaps, that they do not quit me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        They had long since passed to dessert and cigars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My dear Albert,&rdquo; said Debray, rising, &ldquo;it is half-past
        two. Your guest is charming, but you leave the best company to go into the
        worst sometimes. I must return to the minister&rsquo;s. I will tell him of
        the count, and we shall soon know who he is.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Take care,&rdquo; returned Albert; &ldquo;no one has been able to
        accomplish that.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, we have three millions for our police; it is true they are
        almost always spent beforehand, but, no matter, we shall still have fifty
        thousand francs to spend for this purpose.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And when you know, will you tell me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I promise you. <i>Au revoir</i>, Albert. Gentlemen, good morning.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        As he left the room, Debray called out loudly, &ldquo;My carriage.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bravo,&rdquo; said Beauchamp to Albert; &ldquo;I shall not go to
        the Chamber, but I have something better to offer my readers than a speech
        of M. Danglars.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, Beauchamp,&rdquo; returned Morcerf,
        &ldquo;do not deprive me of the merit of introducing him everywhere. Is he
        not peculiar?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is more than that,&rdquo; replied Château-Renaud; &ldquo;he is
        one of the most extraordinary men I ever saw in my life. Are you coming,
        Morrel?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Directly I have given my card to the count, who has promised to pay
        us a visit at Rue Meslay, No. 14.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Be sure I shall not fail to do so,&rdquo; returned the count,
        bowing.
      </p>
      <p>
        And Maximilian Morrel left the room with the Baron de Château-Renaud, leaving
        Monte Cristo alone with Morcerf.
