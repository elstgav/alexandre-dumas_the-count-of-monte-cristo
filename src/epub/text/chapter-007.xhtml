      <h2>Chapter 7. The Examination</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>o sooner had
        Villefort left the salon, than he assumed the grave air of a man who holds
        the balance of life and death in his hands. Now, in spite of the nobility
        of his countenance, the command of which, like a finished actor, he had
        carefully studied before the glass, it was by no means easy for him to
        assume an air of judicial severity. Except the recollection of the line of
        politics his father had adopted, and which might interfere, unless he
        acted with the greatest prudence, with his own career, Gérard de Villefort
        was as happy as a man could be. Already rich, he held a high official
        situation, though only twenty-seven. He was about to marry a young and
        charming woman, whom he loved, not passionately, but reasonably, as became
        a deputy attorney of the king; and besides her personal attractions, which
        were very great, Mademoiselle de Saint-Méran&rsquo;s family possessed
        considerable political influence, which they would, of course, exert in
        his favor. The dowry of his wife amounted to fifty thousand crowns, and he
        had, besides, the prospect of seeing her fortune increased to half a
        million at her father&rsquo;s death. These considerations naturally gave
        Villefort a feeling of such complete felicity that his mind was fairly
        dazzled in its contemplation.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the door he met the commissary of police, who was waiting for him. The
        sight of this officer recalled Villefort from the third heaven to earth;
        he composed his face, as we have before described, and said, &ldquo;I have
        read the letter, sir, and you have acted rightly in arresting this man;
        now inform me what you have discovered concerning him and the conspiracy.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We know nothing as yet of the conspiracy, monsieur; all the papers
        found have been sealed up and placed on your desk. The prisoner himself is
        named Edmond Dantès, mate on board the three-master the <i>Pharaon</i>,
        trading in cotton with Alexandria and Smyrna, and belonging to Morrel
        &amp; Son, of Marseilles.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Before he entered the merchant service, had he ever served in the
        marines?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, no, monsieur, he is very young.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How old?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nineteen or twenty at the most.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment, and as Villefort had arrived at the corner of the Rue des
        Conseils, a man, who seemed to have been waiting for him, approached; it
        was M. Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, M. de Villefort,&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;I am delighted to see
        you. Some of your people have committed the strangest mistake&mdash;they
        have just arrested Edmond Dantès, mate of my vessel.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I know it, monsieur,&rdquo; replied Villefort, &ldquo;and I am now
        going to examine him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Morrel, carried away by his friendship, &ldquo;you
        do not know him, and I do. He is the most estimable, the most trustworthy
        creature in the world, and I will venture to say, there is not a better
        seaman in all the merchant service. Oh, M. de Villefort, I beseech your
        indulgence for him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort, as we have seen, belonged to the aristocratic party at
        Marseilles, Morrel to the plebeian; the first was a royalist, the other
        suspected of Bonapartism. Villefort looked disdainfully at Morrel, and
        replied coldly:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are aware, monsieur, that a man may be estimable and
        trustworthy in private life, and the best seaman in the merchant service,
        and yet be, politically speaking, a great criminal. Is it not true?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The magistrate laid emphasis on these words, as if he wished to apply them
        to the owner himself, while his eyes seemed to plunge into the heart of
        one who, interceding for another, had himself need of indulgence. Morrel
        reddened, for his own conscience was not quite clear on politics; besides,
        what Dantès had told him of his interview with the grand-marshal, and what
        the emperor had said to him, embarrassed him. He replied, however, in a
        tone of deep interest:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I entreat you, M. de Villefort, be, as you always are, kind and
        equitable, and give him back to us soon.&rdquo; This <i>give us</i>
        sounded revolutionary in the deputy&rsquo;s ears.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, ah,&rdquo; murmured he, &ldquo;is Dantès then a member of some
        Carbonari society, that his protector thus employs the collective form? He
        was, if I recollect, arrested in a tavern, in company with a great many
        others.&rdquo; Then he added, &ldquo;Monsieur, you may rest assured I
        shall perform my duty impartially, and that if he be innocent you shall
        not have appealed to me in vain; should he, however, be guilty, in this
        present epoch, impunity would furnish a dangerous example, and I must do
        my duty.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0097m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        As he had now arrived at the door of his own house, which adjoined the
        Palais de Justice, he entered, after having, coldly saluted the shipowner,
        who stood, as if petrified, on the spot where Villefort had left him. The
        antechamber was full of police agents and gendarmes, in the midst of whom,
        carefully watched, but calm and smiling, stood the prisoner. Villefort
        traversed the antechamber, cast a side glance at Dantès, and taking a
        packet which a gendarme offered him, disappeared, saying, &ldquo;Bring in
        the prisoner.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Rapid as had been Villefort&rsquo;s glance, it had served to give him an
        idea of the man he was about to interrogate. He had recognized
        intelligence in the high forehead, courage in the dark eye and bent brow,
        and frankness in the thick lips that showed a set of pearly teeth.
        Villefort&rsquo;s first impression was favorable; but he had been so often
        warned to mistrust first impulses, that he applied the maxim to the
        impression, forgetting the difference between the two words. He stifled,
        therefore, the feelings of compassion that were rising, composed his
        features, and sat down, grim and sombre, at his desk. An instant after
        Dantès entered. He was pale, but calm and collected, and saluting his
        judge with easy politeness, looked round for a seat, as if he had been in
        M. Morrel&rsquo;s salon. It was then that he encountered for the first
        time Villefort&rsquo;s look,&mdash;that look peculiar to the magistrate,
        who, while seeming to read the thoughts of others, betrays nothing of his
        own.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Who and what are you?&rdquo; demanded Villefort, turning over a
        pile of papers, containing information relative to the prisoner, that a
        police agent had given to him on his entry, and that, already, in an hour&rsquo;s
        time, had swelled to voluminous proportions, thanks to the corrupt
        espionage of which &ldquo;the accused&rdquo; is always made the victim.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My name is Edmond Dantès,&rdquo; replied the young man calmly;
        &ldquo;I am mate of the <i>Pharaon</i>, belonging to Messrs. Morrel &amp;
        Son.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your age?&rdquo; continued Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nineteen,&rdquo; returned Dantès.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What were you doing at the moment you were arrested?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I was at the festival of my marriage, monsieur,&rdquo; said the
        young man, his voice slightly tremulous, so great was the contrast between
        that happy moment and the painful ceremony he was now undergoing; so great
        was the contrast between the sombre aspect of M. de Villefort and the
        radiant face of Mercédès.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You were at the festival of your marriage?&rdquo; said the deputy,
        shuddering in spite of himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, monsieur; I am on the point of marrying a young girl I have
        been attached to for three years.&rdquo; Villefort, impassive as he was,
        was struck with this coincidence; and the tremulous voice of Dantès,
        surprised in the midst of his happiness, struck a sympathetic chord in his
        own bosom&mdash;he also was on the point of being married, and he was
        summoned from his own happiness to destroy that of another. &ldquo;This
        philosophic reflection,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;will make a great
        sensation at M. de Saint-Méran&rsquo;s;&rdquo; and he arranged mentally,
        while Dantès awaited further questions, the antithesis by which orators
        often create a reputation for eloquence. When this speech was arranged,
        Villefort turned to Dantès.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0099m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Go on, sir,&rdquo; said he.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What would you have me say?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Give all the information in your power.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Tell me on which point you desire information, and I will tell all
        I know; only,&rdquo; added he, with a smile, &ldquo;I warn you I know very
        little.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you served under the usurper?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I was about to be mustered into the Royal Marines when he fell.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is reported your political opinions are extreme,&rdquo; said
        Villefort, who had never heard anything of the kind, but was not sorry to
        make this inquiry, as if it were an accusation.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My political opinions!&rdquo; replied Dantès. &ldquo;Alas, sir, I
        never had any opinions. I am hardly nineteen; I know nothing; I have no
        part to play. If I obtain the situation I desire, I shall owe it to M.
        Morrel. Thus all my opinions&mdash;I will not say public, but private&mdash;are
        confined to these three sentiments,&mdash;I love my father, I respect M.
        Morrel, and I adore Mercédès. This, sir, is all I can tell you, and you
        see how uninteresting it is.&rdquo; As Dantès spoke, Villefort gazed at
        his ingenuous and open countenance, and recollected the words of Renée,
        who, without knowing who the culprit was, had besought his indulgence for
        him. With the deputy&rsquo;s knowledge of crime and criminals, every word
        the young man uttered convinced him more and more of his innocence. This
        lad, for he was scarcely a man,&mdash;simple, natural, eloquent with that
        eloquence of the heart never found when sought for; full of affection for
        everybody, because he was happy, and because happiness renders even the
        wicked good&mdash;extended his affection even to his judge, spite of
        Villefort&rsquo;s severe look and stern accent. Dantès seemed full of
        kindness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>&ldquo;Pardieu!&rdquo;</i> said Villefort, &ldquo;he is a noble fellow.
        I hope I shall gain Renée&rsquo;s favor easily by obeying the first
        command she ever imposed on me. I shall have at least a pressure of the
        hand in public, and a sweet kiss in private.&rdquo; Full of this idea,
        Villefort&rsquo;s face became so joyous, that when he turned to Dantès,
        the latter, who had watched the change on his physiognomy, was smiling
        also.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Villefort, &ldquo;have you any enemies, at least,
        that you know.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have enemies?&rdquo; replied Dantès; &ldquo;my position is not
        sufficiently elevated for that. As for my disposition, that is, perhaps,
        somewhat too hasty; but I have striven to repress it. I have had ten or
        twelve sailors under me, and if you question them, they will tell you that
        they love and respect me, not as a father, for I am too young, but as an
        elder brother.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But you may have excited jealousy. You are about to become captain
        at nineteen&mdash;an elevated post; you are about to marry a pretty girl,
        who loves you; and these two pieces of good fortune may have excited the
        envy of someone.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are right; you know men better than I do, and what you say may
        possibly be the case, I confess; but if such persons are among my
        acquaintances I prefer not to know it, because then I should be forced to
        hate them.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are wrong; you should always strive to see clearly around you.
        You seem a worthy young man; I will depart from the strict line of my duty
        to aid you in discovering the author of this accusation. Here is the
        paper; do you know the writing?&rdquo; As he spoke, Villefort drew the
        letter from his pocket, and presented it to Dantès. Dantès read it. A
        cloud passed over his brow as he said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, monsieur, I do not know the writing, and yet it is tolerably
        plain. Whoever did it writes well. I am very fortunate,&rdquo; added he,
        looking gratefully at Villefort, &ldquo;to be examined by such a man as
        you; for this envious person is a real enemy.&rdquo; And by the rapid
        glance that the young man&rsquo;s eyes shot forth, Villefort saw how much
        energy lay hid beneath this mildness.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the deputy, &ldquo;answer me frankly, not as a
        prisoner to a judge, but as one man to another who takes an interest in
        him, what truth is there in the accusation contained in this anonymous
        letter?&rdquo; And Villefort threw disdainfully on his desk the letter
        Dantès had just given back to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;None at all. I will tell you the real facts. I swear by my honor as
        a sailor, by my love for Mercédès, by the life of my father&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Speak, monsieur,&rdquo; said Villefort. Then, internally, &ldquo;If
        Renée could see me, I hope she would be satisfied, and would no longer
        call me a decapitator.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, when we quitted Naples, Captain Leclere was attacked with a
        brain fever. As we had no doctor on board, and he was so anxious to arrive
        at Elba, that he would not touch at any other port, his disorder rose to
        such a height, that at the end of the third day, feeling he was dying, he
        called me to him. &lsquo;My dear Dantès,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;swear to
        perform what I am going to tell you, for it is a matter of the deepest
        importance.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;I swear, captain,&rsquo; replied I.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, as after my death the command devolves on you as mate,
        assume the command, and bear up for the Island of Elba, disembark at
        Porto-Ferrajo, ask for the grand-marshal, give him this letter&mdash;perhaps
        they will give you another letter, and charge you with a commission. You
        will accomplish what I was to have done, and derive all the honor and
        profit from it.&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;I will do it, captain; but perhaps I shall not be admitted
        to the grand-marshal&rsquo;s presence as easily as you expect?&rsquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;&lsquo;Here is a ring that will obtain audience of him, and remove
        every difficulty,&rsquo; said the captain. At these words he gave me a
        ring. It was time&mdash;two hours after he was delirious; the next day he
        died.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what did you do then?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What I ought to have done, and what everyone would have done in my
        place. Everywhere the last requests of a dying man are sacred; but with a
        sailor the last requests of his superior are commands. I sailed for the
        Island of Elba, where I arrived the next day; I ordered everybody to
        remain on board, and went on shore alone. As I had expected, I found some
        difficulty in obtaining access to the grand-marshal; but I sent the ring I
        had received from the captain to him, and was instantly admitted. He
        questioned me concerning Captain Leclere&rsquo;s death; and, as the latter
        had told me, gave me a letter to carry on to a person in Paris. I
        undertook it because it was what my captain had bade me do. I landed here,
        regulated the affairs of the vessel, and hastened to visit my affianced
        bride, whom I found more lovely than ever. Thanks to M. Morrel, all the
        forms were got over; in a word I was, as I told you, at my marriage feast;
        and I should have been married in an hour, and tomorrow I intended to
        start for Paris, had I not been arrested on this charge which you as well
        as I now see to be unjust.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Villefort, &ldquo;this seems to me the truth. If
        you have been culpable, it was imprudence, and this imprudence was in
        obedience to the orders of your captain. Give up this letter you have
        brought from Elba, and pass your word you will appear should you be
        required, and go and rejoin your friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am free, then, sir?&rdquo; cried Dantès joyfully.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; but first give me this letter.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have it already, for it was taken from me with some others
        which I see in that packet.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Stop a moment,&rdquo; said the deputy, as Dantès took his hat and
        gloves. &ldquo;To whom is it addressed?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>&ldquo;To Monsieur Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, Paris.&rdquo;</i> Had a
        thunderbolt fallen into the room, Villefort could not have been more
        stupefied. He sank into his seat, and hastily turning over the packet,
        drew forth the fatal letter, at which he glanced with an expression of
        terror.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;M. Noirtier, Rue Coq-Héron, No. 13,&rdquo; murmured he, growing
        still paler.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Dantès; &ldquo;do you know him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Villefort; &ldquo;a faithful servant of the king
        does not know conspirators.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0103m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is a conspiracy, then?&rdquo; asked Dantès, who after believing
        himself free, now began to feel a tenfold alarm. &ldquo;I have, however,
        already told you, sir, I was entirely ignorant of the contents of the
        letter.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; but you knew the name of the person to whom it was addressed,&rdquo;
        said Villefort.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I was forced to read the address to know to whom to give it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have you shown this letter to anyone?&rdquo; asked Villefort,
        becoming still more pale.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To no one, on my honor.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Everybody is ignorant that you are the bearer of a letter from the
        Island of Elba, and addressed to M. Noirtier?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Everybody, except the person who gave it to me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And that was too much, far too much,&rdquo; murmured Villefort.
        Villefort&rsquo;s brow darkened more and more, his white lips and clenched
        teeth filled Dantès with apprehension. After reading the letter, Villefort
        covered his face with his hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Dantès timidly, &ldquo;what is the matter?&rdquo;
        Villefort made no answer, but raised his head at the expiration of a few
        seconds, and again perused the letter.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you say that you are ignorant of the contents of this letter?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I give you my word of honor, sir,&rdquo; said Dantès; &ldquo;but
        what is the matter? You are ill&mdash;shall I ring for assistance?&mdash;shall
        I call?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Villefort, rising hastily; &ldquo;stay where you
        are. It is for me to give orders here, and not you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; replied Dantès proudly, &ldquo;it was only to
        summon assistance for you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I want none; it was a temporary indisposition. Attend to yourself;
        answer me.&rdquo; Dantès waited, expecting a question, but in vain.
        Villefort fell back on his chair, passed his hand over his brow, moist
        with perspiration, and, for the third time, read the letter.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, if he knows the contents of this!&rdquo; murmured he, &ldquo;and
        that Noirtier is the father of Villefort, I am lost!&rdquo; And he fixed
        his eyes upon Edmond as if he would have penetrated his thoughts.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, it is impossible to doubt it,&rdquo; cried he, suddenly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In heaven&rsquo;s name!&rdquo; cried the unhappy young man, &ldquo;if
        you doubt me, question me; I will answer you.&rdquo; Villefort made a
        violent effort, and in a tone he strove to render firm:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am no longer able, as I had hoped, to
        restore you immediately to liberty; before doing so, I must consult the
        trial justice; what my own feeling is you already know.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, monsieur,&rdquo; cried Dantès, &ldquo;you have been rather a
        friend than a judge.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/0105m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, I must detain you some time longer, but I will strive to make
        it as short as possible. The principal charge against you is this letter,
        and you see&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Villefort approached the fire, cast it
        in, and waited until it was entirely consumed.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You see, I destroy it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; exclaimed Dantès, &ldquo;you are goodness itself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; continued Villefort; &ldquo;you can now have
        confidence in me after what I have done.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, command, and I will obey.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen; this is not a command, but advice I give you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Speak, and I will follow your advice.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I shall detain you until this evening in the Palais de Justice.
        Should anyone else interrogate you, say to him what you have said to me,
        but do not breathe a word of this letter.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I promise.&rdquo; It was Villefort who seemed to entreat, and the
        prisoner who reassured him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; continued he, glancing toward the grate, where
        fragments of burnt paper fluttered in the flames, &ldquo;the letter is
        destroyed; you and I alone know of its existence; should you, therefore,
        be questioned, deny all knowledge of it&mdash;deny it boldly, and you are
        saved.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Be satisfied; I will deny it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It was the only letter you had?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It was.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Swear it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I swear it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Villefort rang. A police agent entered. Villefort whispered some words in
        his ear, to which the officer replied by a motion of his head.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Follow him,&rdquo; said Villefort to Dantès. Dantès saluted
        Villefort and retired. Hardly had the door closed when Villefort threw
        himself half-fainting into a chair.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Alas, alas,&rdquo; murmured he, &ldquo;if the procureur himself had
        been at Marseilles I should have been ruined. This accursed letter would
        have destroyed all my hopes. Oh, my father, must your past career always
        interfere with my successes?&rdquo; Suddenly a light passed over his face,
        a smile played round his set mouth, and his haggard eyes were fixed in
        thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This will do,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and from this letter, which
        might have ruined me, I will make my fortune. Now to the work I have in
        hand.&rdquo; And after having assured himself that the prisoner was gone,
        the deputy procureur hastened to the house of his betrothed.
