      <h2>Chapter 98. The Bell and Bottle Tavern</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nd now let us
        leave Mademoiselle Danglars and her friend pursuing their way to Brussels,
        and return to poor Andrea Cavalcanti, so inopportunely interrupted in his
        rise to fortune. Notwithstanding his youth, Master Andrea was a very
        skilful and intelligent boy. We have seen that on the first rumor which
        reached the salon he had gradually approached the door, and crossing two
        or three rooms at last disappeared. But we have forgotten to mention one
        circumstance, which nevertheless ought not to be omitted; in one of the
        rooms he crossed, the <i>trousseau</i> of the bride-elect was on exhibition.
        There were caskets of diamonds, cashmere shawls, Valenciennes lace,
        English veils, and in fact all the tempting things, the bare mention of
        which makes the hearts of young girls bound with joy, and which is called
        the <i>corbeille</i>.<a href="#linknote-22" name="linknoteref-22" id="linknoteref-22">22</a> Now,
        in passing through this room, Andrea proved himself not only to be clever
        and intelligent, but also provident, for he helped himself to the most
        valuable of the ornaments before him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furnished with this plunder, Andrea leaped with a lighter heart from the
        window, intending to slip through the hands of the gendarmes. Tall and
        well proportioned as an ancient gladiator, and muscular as a Spartan, he
        walked for a quarter of an hour without knowing where to direct his steps,
        actuated by the sole idea of getting away from the spot where if he
        lingered he knew that he would surely be taken. Having passed through the
        Rue du Mont-Blanc, guided by the instinct which leads thieves always to take
        the safest path, he found himself at the end of the Rue La Fayette. There
        he stopped, breathless and panting. He was quite alone; on one side was
        the vast wilderness of the Saint-Lazare, on the other, Paris enshrouded in
        darkness.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Am I to be captured?&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;no, not if I can use more
        activity than my enemies. My safety is now a mere question of speed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment he saw a cab at the top of the Faubourg Poissonnière. The dull
        driver, smoking his pipe, was plodding along toward the limits of the Faubourg
        Saint-Denis, where no doubt he ordinarily had his station.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ho, friend!&rdquo; said Benedetto.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What do you want, sir?&rdquo; asked the driver.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Is your horse tired?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Tired? oh, yes, tired enough&mdash;he has done nothing the whole of
        this blessed day! Four wretched fares, and twenty sous over, making in all
        seven francs, are all that I have earned, and I ought to take ten to the
        owner.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Will you add these twenty francs to the seven you have?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;With pleasure, sir; twenty francs are not to be despised. Tell me
        what I am to do for this.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A very easy thing, if your horse isn&rsquo;t tired.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I tell you he&rsquo;ll go like the wind,&mdash;only tell me which
        way to drive.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Towards the Louvres.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, I know the way&mdash;you get good sweetened rum over there.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Exactly so; I merely wish to overtake one of my friends, with whom
        I am going to hunt tomorrow at Chapelle-en-Serval. He should have waited
        for me here with a cabriolet till half-past eleven; it is twelve, and,
        tired of waiting, he must have gone on.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is likely.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, will you try and overtake him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing I should like better.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;If you do not overtake him before we reach Bourget you shall have
        twenty francs; if not before Louvres, thirty.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And if we do overtake him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Forty,&rdquo; said Andrea, after a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, at
        the end of which he remembered that he might safely promise.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said the man; &ldquo;hop in, and
        we&rsquo;re off! Who-o-o-pla!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Andrea got into the cab, which passed rapidly through the Faubourg
        Saint-Denis, along the Faubourg Saint-Martin, crossed the barrier, and
        threaded its way through the interminable Villette. They never overtook
        the chimerical friend, yet Andrea frequently inquired of people on foot
        whom he passed and at the inns which were not yet closed, for a green
        cabriolet and bay horse; and as there are a great many cabriolets to be
        seen on the road to the Low Countries, and as nine-tenths of them are
        green, the inquiries increased at every step. Everyone had just seen it
        pass; it was only five hundred, two hundred, one hundred steps in advance;
        at length they reached it, but it was not the friend. Once the cab was
        also passed by a calash rapidly whirled along by two post-horses.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Cavalcanti to himself, &ldquo;if I only had that britzka,
        those two good post-horses, and above all the passport that carries them on!&rdquo;
        And he sighed deeply.
      </p>
      <p>
        The calash contained Mademoiselle Danglars and Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Armilly.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Hurry, hurry!&rdquo; said Andrea, &ldquo;we must overtake him soon.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And the poor horse resumed the desperate gallop it had kept up since leaving the
        barrier, and arrived steaming at Louvres.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Andrea, &ldquo;I shall not overtake my
        friend, but I shall kill your horse, therefore I had better stop. Here are
        thirty francs; I will sleep at the <i>Cheval Rouge</i>, and will secure a place in
        the first coach. Good-night, friend.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And Andrea, after placing six pieces of five francs each in the man&rsquo;s hand,
        leaped lightly on to the pathway. The cabman joyfully pocketed the sum, and turned
        back on his road to Paris. Andrea pretended to go towards the hotel of the
        <i>Cheval Rouge</i>, but after leaning an instant against the door, and hearing the
        last sound of the cab, which was disappearing from view, he went on his road, and
        with a lusty stride soon traversed the space of two leagues. Then he rested; he
        must be near Chapelle-en-Serval, where he pretended to be going.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was not fatigue that stayed Andrea here; it was that he might form some
        resolution, adopt some plan. It would be impossible to make use of a
        diligence, equally so to engage post-horses; to travel either way a
        passport was necessary. It was still more impossible to remain in the
        department of the Oise, one of the most open and strictly guarded in
        France; this was quite out of the question, especially to a man like
        Andrea, perfectly conversant with criminal matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        He sat down by the side of the moat, buried his face in his hands and
        reflected. Ten minutes after he raised his head; his resolution was made.
        He threw some dust over the topcoat, which he had found time to unhook
        from the antechamber and button over his ball costume, and going to
        Chapelle-en-Serval he knocked loudly at the door of the only inn in the place.
      </p>
      <p>
        The host opened.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Andrea, &ldquo;I was coming from Mortefontaine to
        Senlis, when my horse, which is a troublesome creature, stumbled and threw me.
        I must reach Compiègne tonight, or I shall cause deep anxiety to my family.
        Could you let me hire a horse of you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        An innkeeper has always a horse to let, whether it be good or bad. The
        host called the stable-boy, and ordered him to saddle <i>Le Blanc</i>
        then he awoke his son, a child of seven years, whom he ordered to ride
        before the gentleman and bring back the horse. Andrea gave the innkeeper
        twenty francs, and in taking them from his pocket dropped a visiting card.
        This belonged to one of his friends at the Café de Paris, so that the
        innkeeper, picking it up after Andrea had left, was convinced that he had
        let his horse to the Count of Mauléon, 25 Rue Saint-Dominique, that being
        the name and address on the card.
      </p>
      <p>
        <i>Le Blanc</i> was not a fast animal, but he kept up an easy, steady pace;
        in three hours and a half Andrea had traversed the nine leagues which separated him
        from Compiègne, and four o&rsquo;clock struck as he reached the place where the
        coaches stop. There is an excellent tavern at Compiègne, well remembered by those
        who have ever been there. Andrea, who had often stayed there in his rides
        about Paris, recollected the Bell and Bottle inn; he turned around, saw
        the sign by the light of a reflected lamp, and having dismissed the child,
        giving him all the small coin he had about him, he began knocking at the
        door, very reasonably concluding that having now three or four hours
        before him he had best fortify himself against the fatigues of the morrow
        by a sound sleep and a good supper. A waiter opened the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Andrea, &ldquo;I have been dining at
        Saint-Jean-aux-Bois, and expected to catch the coach which passes by at
        midnight, but like a fool I have lost my way, and have been walking for
        the last four hours in the forest. Show me into one of those pretty little
        rooms which overlook the court, and bring me a cold fowl and a bottle of
        Bordeaux.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The waiter had no suspicions; Andrea spoke with perfect composure, he had a cigar
        in his mouth, and his hands in the pocket of his top coat; his clothes were
        fashionably made, his chin smooth, his boots irreproachable; he looked merely as
        if he had stayed out very late, that was all. While the waiter was preparing his
        room, the hostess arose; Andrea assumed his most charming smile, and asked if he
        could have No. 3, which he had occupied on his last stay at Compiègne.
        Unfortunately, No. 3 was engaged by a young man who was travelling with his
        sister. Andrea appeared in despair, but consoled himself when the hostess assured
        him that No. 7, prepared for him, was situated precisely the same as No. 3,
        and while warming his feet and chatting about the last races at Chantilly,
        he waited until they announced his room to be ready.
      </p>
      <p>
        Andrea had not spoken without cause of the pretty rooms looking out upon
        the court of the Bell Hotel, which with its triple galleries like those
        of a theatre, with the jessamine and clematis twining round the light
        columns, forms one of the prettiest entrances to an inn that you can
        imagine. The fowl was tender, the wine old, the fire clear and sparkling,
        and Andrea was surprised to find himself eating with as good an appetite
        as though nothing had happened. Then he went to bed and almost immediately
        fell into that deep sleep which is sure to visit men of twenty years of
        age, even when they are torn with remorse. Now, here we are obliged to own
        that Andrea ought to have felt remorse, but that he did not.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was the plan which had appealed to him to afford the best chance of his
        security. Before daybreak he would awake, leave the inn after rigorously paying
        his bill, and reaching the forest, he would, under pretence of making studies
        in painting, test the hospitality of some peasants, procure himself the
        dress of a woodcutter and a hatchet, casting off the lion&rsquo;s skin to
        assume that of the woodman; then, with his hands covered with dirt, his
        hair darkened by means of a leaden comb, his complexion embrowned with a
        preparation for which one of his old comrades had given him the recipe, he
        intended, by following the wooded districts, to reach the nearest
        frontier, walking by night and sleeping in the day in the forests and
        quarries, and only entering inhabited regions to buy a loaf from time to
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once past the frontier, Andrea proposed making money of his diamonds; and
        by uniting the proceeds to ten bank-notes he always carried about with him
        in case of accident, he would then find himself possessor of about 50,000
        livres, which he philosophically considered as no very deplorable
        condition after all. Moreover, he reckoned much on the interest of the
        Danglars to hush up the rumor of their own misadventures. These were the
        reasons which, added to the fatigue, caused Andrea to sleep so soundly. In
        order that he might wake early he did not close the shutters, but
        contented himself with bolting the door and placing on the table an
        unclasped and long-pointed knife, whose temper he well knew, and which was
        never absent from him.
      </p>
      <p>
        About seven in the morning Andrea was awakened by a ray of sunlight, which played,
        warm and brilliant, upon his face. In all well-organized brains, the predominating
        idea&mdash;and there always is one&mdash;is sure to be the last thought before
        sleeping, and the first upon waking in the morning. Andrea had scarcely opened his
        eyes when his predominating idea presented itself, and whispered in his ear that
        he had slept too long. He jumped out of bed and ran to the window. A gendarme was
        crossing the court. A gendarme is one of the most striking objects in the
        world, even to a man void of uneasiness; but for one who has a timid
        conscience, and with good cause too, the yellow, blue, and white uniform
        is really very alarming.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why is that gendarme there?&rdquo; asked Andrea of himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, all at once, he replied, with that logic which the reader has, doubtless,
        remarked in him, &ldquo;There is nothing astonishing in seeing a gendarme
        at an inn; instead of being astonished, let me dress myself.&rdquo; And
        the youth dressed himself with a facility his valet de chambre had failed
        to rob him of during the two months of fashionable life he had led in Paris.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; said Andrea, while dressing himself, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
        wait till he leaves, and then I&rsquo;ll slip away.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50047m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        And, saying this, Andrea, who had now put on his boots and cravat, stole gently
        to the window, and a second time lifted up the muslin curtain. Not only was the
        first gendarme still there, but the young man now perceived a second yellow, blue,
        and white uniform at the foot of the staircase, the only one by which he could
        descend, while a third, on horseback, holding a musket in his fist, was posted as
        a sentinel at the great street-door which alone afforded the means of egress.
        The appearance of the third gendarme settled the matter, for a crowd of curious
        loungers was extended before him, effectually blocking the entrance to the hotel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;They&rsquo;re after me!&rdquo; was Andrea&rsquo;s first thought.
        &ldquo;<i>Diable!</i>&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        A pallor overspread the young man&rsquo;s forehead, and he looked around him with
        anxiety. His room, like all those on the same floor, had but one outlet to the
        gallery in the sight of everybody. &ldquo;I am lost!&rdquo; was his second thought;
        and, indeed, for a man in Andrea&rsquo;s situation, an arrest meant the assizes,
        trial, and death,&mdash;death without mercy or delay.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a moment he convulsively pressed his head within his hands, and during that
        brief period he became nearly mad with terror; but soon a ray of hope glimmered
        in the multitude of thoughts which bewildered his mind, and a faint smile played
        upon his white lips and pallid cheeks. He looked around and saw the objects of his
        search upon the chimney-piece; they were a pen, ink, and paper. With forced
        composure he dipped the pen in the ink, and wrote the following lines upon a
        sheet of paper:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have no money to pay my bill, but I am not a dishonest man; I
        leave behind me as a pledge this pin, worth ten times the amount. I shall
        be excused for leaving at daybreak, for I was ashamed.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He then drew the pin from his cravat and placed it on the paper. This
        done, instead of leaving the door fastened, he drew back the bolts and
        even placed the door ajar, as though he had left the room, forgetting to
        close it, and slipping into the chimney like a man accustomed to that kind
        of gymnastic exercise, after replacing the chimney-board, which represented
        Achilles with Deidamia, and effacing the very marks of his feet upon the
        ashes, he commenced climbing the hollow tunnel, which afforded him the only
        means of escape left.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this precise time, the first gendarme Andrea had noticed walked upstairs,
        preceded by the commissary of police, and supported by the second gendarme who
        guarded the staircase and was himself reinforced by the one stationed at the door.
      </p>
      <p>
        Andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances. At
        daybreak, the telegraphs were set at work in all directions, and almost
        immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost
        endeavors to arrest the murderer of Caderousse. Compiègne, that royal
        residence and fortified town, is well furnished with authorities,
        gendarmes, and commissaries of police; they therefore began operations as
        soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived, and the Bell and Bottle being
        the best-known hotel in the town, they had naturally directed their first
        inquiries there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the Hôtel de Ville,
        which is next door to the Bell and Bottle, it had been stated by others
        that a number of travellers had arrived during the night. The sentinel who
        was relieved at six o&rsquo;clock in the morning, remembered perfectly
        that, just as he was taking his post a few minutes past four, a young man
        arrived on horseback, with a little boy before him. The young man, having
        dismissed the boy and horse, knocked at the door of the hotel, which was
        opened, and again closed after his entrance. This late arrival had
        attracted much suspicion, and the young man being no other than Andrea,
        the commissary and gendarme, who was a brigadier, directed their steps
        towards his room. They found the door ajar.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, oh,&rdquo; said the brigadier, who thoroughly understood the trick;
        &ldquo;a bad sign to find the door open! I would rather find it triply
        bolted.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And, indeed, the little note and pin upon the table confirmed, or rather
        corroborated, the sad truth. Andrea had fled. We say corroborated, because the
        brigadier was too experienced to be convinced by a single proof. He glanced around,
        looked in the bed, shook the curtains, opened the closets, and finally stopped at
        the chimney. Andrea had taken the precaution to leave no traces of his feet in
        the ashes, but still it was an outlet, and in this light was not to be passed
        over without serious investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The brigadier sent for some sticks and straw, and having filled the
        chimney with them, set a light to it. The fire crackled, and the smoke
        ascended like the dull vapor from a volcano; but still no prisoner fell
        down, as they expected. The fact was, that Andrea, at war with society
        ever since his youth, was quite as deep as a gendarme, even though he were
        advanced to the rank of brigadier, and quite prepared for the fire, he had
        climbed out on the roof and was crouching down against the chimney-pots.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50049m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        At one time he thought he was saved, for he heard the brigadier exclaim in
        a loud voice, to the two gendarmes, &ldquo;He is not here!&rdquo; But
        venturing to peep, he perceived that the latter, instead of retiring, as
        might have been reasonably expected upon this announcement, were watching
        with increased attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was now his turn to look about him; the Hôtel de Ville, a massive
        sixteenth century building, was on his right; anyone could descend from
        the openings in the tower, and examine every corner of the roof below, and
        Andrea expected momentarily to see the head of a gendarme appear at one of
        these openings. If once discovered, he knew he would be lost, for the roof
        afforded no chance of escape; he therefore resolved to descend, not
        through the same chimney by which he had come up, but by a similar one
        conducting to another room.
      </p>
      <p>
        He looked around for a chimney from which no smoke issued, and having reached it,
        he disappeared through the orifice without being seen by anyone. At the same
        minute, one of the little windows of the Hôtel de Ville was thrown open, and the
        head of a gendarme appeared. For an instant it remained motionless as one of the
        stone decorations of the building, then after a long sigh of disappointment the
        head disappeared. The brigadier, calm and dignified as the law he
        represented, passed through the crowd, without answering the thousand
        questions addressed to him, and re-entered the hotel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; asked the two gendarmes.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, my boys,&rdquo; said the brigadier, &ldquo;the brigand must
        really have escaped early this morning; but we will send to the
        Villers-Coterets and Noyon roads, and search the forest, when we shall
        catch him, no doubt.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The honorable functionary had scarcely expressed himself thus, in that intonation
        which is peculiar to brigadiers of the gendarmerie, when a loud scream, accompanied
        by the violent ringing of a bell, resounded through the court of the hotel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, what is that?&rdquo; cried the brigadier.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Some traveller seems impatient,&rdquo; said the host. &ldquo;What
        number was it that rang?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Number 3.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Run, waiter!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment the screams and ringing were redoubled.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said the brigadier, stopping the servant, &ldquo;the person who
        is ringing appears to want something more than amwaiter; we will attend upon him
        with a gendarme. Who occupies Number 3?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The little fellow who arrived last night in a post-chaise with his
        sister, and who asked for an apartment with two beds.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The bell here rang for the third time, with another shriek of anguish.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Follow me, Mr. Commissary!&rdquo; said the brigadier; &ldquo;tread
        in my steps.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Wait an instant,&rdquo; said the host; &ldquo;Number 3 has two
        staircases,&mdash;inside and outside.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; said the brigadier. &ldquo;I will take charge of the
        inside one. Are the carbines loaded?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, brigadier.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, you guard the exterior, and if he attempts to fly, fire upon
        him; he must be a great criminal, from what the telegraph says.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The brigadier, followed by the commissary, disappeared by the inside
        staircase, accompanied by the noise which his assertions respecting Andrea
        had excited in the crowd.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is what had happened: Andrea had very cleverly managed to descend
        two-thirds of the chimney, but then his foot slipped, and notwithstanding
        his endeavors, he came into the room with more speed and noise than he
        intended. It would have signified little had the room been empty, but
        unfortunately it was occupied. Two ladies, sleeping in one bed, were
        awakened by the noise, and fixing their eyes upon the spot whence the
        sound proceeded, they saw a man. One of these ladies, the fair one,
        uttered those terrible shrieks which resounded through the house, while
        the other, rushing to the bell-rope, rang with all her strength. Andrea,
        as we can see, was surrounded by misfortune.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; he cried, pale and bewildered,
        without seeing whom he was addressing,&mdash;&ldquo;for pity&rsquo;s sake
        do not call assistance! Save me!&mdash;I will not harm you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Andrea, the murderer!&rdquo; cried one of the ladies.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Eugénie! Mademoiselle Danglars!&rdquo; exclaimed Andrea, stupefied.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Help, help!&rdquo; cried Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Armilly, taking the
        bell from her companion&rsquo;s hand, and ringing it yet more violently.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Save me, I am pursued!&rdquo; said Andrea, clasping his hands.
        &ldquo;For pity, for mercy&rsquo;s sake do not deliver me up!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is too late, they are coming,&rdquo; said Eugénie.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, conceal me somewhere; you can say you were needlessly
        alarmed; you can turn their suspicions and save my life!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50053m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        The two ladies, pressing closely to one another, and drawing the
        bedclothes tightly around them, remained silent to this supplicating
        voice, repugnance and fear taking possession of their minds.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, be it so,&rdquo; at length said Eugénie; &ldquo;return by the
        same road you came, and we will say nothing about you, unhappy wretch.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Here he is, here he is!&rdquo; cried a voice from the landing;
        &ldquo;here he is! I see him!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The brigadier had put his eye to the keyhole, and had discovered Andrea in a
        posture of entreaty. A violent blow from the butt end of the musket burst open
        the lock, two more forced out the bolts, and the broken door fell in. Andrea ran
        to the other door, leading to the gallery, ready to rush out; but he was stopped
        short, and he stood with his body a little thrown back, pale, and with the
        useless knife in his clenched hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Fly, then!&rdquo; cried Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Armilly, whose pity
        returned as her fears diminished; &ldquo;fly!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Or kill yourself!&rdquo; said Eugénie (in a tone which a Vestal in
        the amphitheatre would have used, when urging the victorious gladiator to
        finish his vanquished adversary). Andrea shuddered, and looked on the
        young girl with an expression which proved how little he understood such
        ferocious honor.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Kill myself?&rdquo; he cried, throwing down his knife; &ldquo;why
        should I do so?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, you said,&rdquo; answered Mademoiselle Danglars, &ldquo;that
        you would be condemned to die like the worst criminals.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50055m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bah,&rdquo; said Cavalcanti, crossing his arms, &ldquo;one has
        friends.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The brigadier advanced to him, sword in hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; said Andrea, &ldquo;sheathe your sword, my fine fellow;
        there is no occasion to make such a fuss, since I give myself up;&rdquo; and he
        held out his hands to be manacled.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two girls looked with horror upon this shameful metamorphosis, the man of the
        world shaking off his covering and appearing as a galley-slave. Andrea turned
        towards them, and with an impertinent smile asked, &ldquo;Have you any
        message for your father, Mademoiselle Danglars, for in all probability I shall
        return to Paris?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Eugénie covered her face with her hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, oh!&rdquo; said Andrea, &ldquo;you need not be ashamed, even though
        you did post after me. Was I not nearly your husband?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50056m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        And with this raillery Andrea went out, leaving the two girls a prey to
        their own feelings of shame, and to the comments of the crowd. An hour
        after they stepped into their calash, both dressed in feminine attire. The
        gate of the hotel had been closed to screen them from sight, but they were
        forced, when the door was open, to pass through a throng of curious
        glances and whispering voices.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eugénie closed her eyes; but though she could not see, she could hear, and the
        sneers of the crowd reached her in the carriage.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, why is not the world a wilderness?&rdquo; she exclaimed, throwing
        herself into the arms of Mademoiselle d&rsquo;Armilly, her eyes sparkling with
        the same kind of rage which made Nero wish that the Roman world had but one neck,
        that he might sever it at a single blow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day they stopped at the Hôtel de Flandre, at Brussels. The same
        evening Andrea was incarcerated in the Conciergerie.
