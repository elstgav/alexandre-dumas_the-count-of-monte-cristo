      <h2>Chapter 105. The Cemetery of Père-Lachaise</h2>
      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>. de Boville had
        indeed met the funeral procession which was taking Valentine to her last
        home on earth. The weather was dull and stormy, a cold wind shook the few
        remaining yellow leaves from the boughs of the trees, and scattered them
        among the crowd which filled the boulevards. M. de Villefort, a true
        Parisian, considered the cemetery of Père-Lachaise alone worthy of
        receiving the mortal remains of a Parisian family; there alone the corpses
        belonging to him would be surrounded by worthy associates. He had
        therefore purchased a vault, which was quickly occupied by members of his
        family. On the front of the monument was inscribed: &ldquo;The families of
        Saint-Méran and Villefort,&rdquo; for such had been the last wish
        expressed by poor Renée, Valentine&rsquo;s mother. The pompous procession
        therefore wended its way towards Père-Lachaise from the Faubourg
        Saint-Honoré. Having crossed Paris, it passed through the Faubourg du
        Temple, then leaving the exterior boulevards, it reached the cemetery.
        More than fifty private carriages followed the twenty mourning-coaches,
        and behind them more than five hundred persons joined in the procession on
        foot.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50117m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        These last consisted of all the young people whom Valentine&rsquo;s death
        had struck like a thunderbolt, and who, notwithstanding the raw chilliness
        of the season, could not refrain from paying a last tribute to the memory
        of the beautiful, chaste, and adorable girl, thus cut off in the flower of
        her youth.
      </p>
      <p>
        As they left Paris, an equipage with four horses, at full speed, was seen to
        draw up suddenly; it contained Monte Cristo. The count left the carriage and
        mingled in the crowd who followed on foot. Château-Renaud perceived him and
        immediately alighting from his <i>coupé</i>, joined him; Beauchamp did the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        The count looked attentively through every opening in the crowd; he was
        evidently watching for someone, but his search ended in disappointment.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50119m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Where is Morrel?&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;do either of these
        gentlemen know where he is?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;We have already asked that question,&rdquo; said Château-Renaud,
        &ldquo;for none of us has seen him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The count was silent, but continued to gaze around him. At length they arrived at
        the cemetery. The piercing eye of Monte Cristo glanced through clusters of bushes
        and trees, and was soon relieved from all anxiety, for seeing a shadow glide
        between the yew-trees, Monte Cristo recognized him whom he sought.
      </p>
      <p>
        One funeral is generally very much like another in this magnificent metropolis.
        Black figures are seen scattered over the long white avenues; the silence of
        earth and heaven is alone broken by the noise made by the crackling
        branches of hedges planted around the monuments; then follows the
        melancholy chant of the priests, mingled now and then with a sob of
        anguish, escaping from some woman concealed behind a mass of flowers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The shadow Monte Cristo had noticed passed rapidly behind the tomb of
        Abélard and Héloïse, placed itself close to the heads of the horses
        belonging to the hearse, and following the undertaker&rsquo;s men, arrived
        with them at the spot appointed for the burial. Each person&rsquo;s
        attention was occupied. Monte Cristo saw nothing but the shadow, which no
        one else observed. Twice the count left the ranks to see whether the
        object of his interest had any concealed weapon beneath his clothes. When
        the procession stopped, this shadow was recognized as Morrel, who, with
        his coat buttoned up to his throat, his face livid, and convulsively
        crushing his hat between his fingers, leaned against a tree, situated on
        an elevation commanding the mausoleum, so that none of the funeral details
        could escape his observation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything was conducted in the usual manner. A few men, the least impressed of
        all by the scene, pronounced a discourse, some deploring this premature death,
        others expatiating on the grief of the father, and one very ingenious person
        quoting the fact that Valentine had solicited pardon of her father for criminals
        on whom the arm of justice was ready to fall&mdash;until at length they exhausted
        their stores of metaphor and mournful speeches, elaborate variations on the
        stanzas of Malherbe to Du Périer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo heard and saw nothing, or rather he only saw Morrel, whose
        calmness had a frightful effect on those who knew what was passing in his
        heart.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;See,&rdquo; said Beauchamp, pointing out Morrel to Debray. &ldquo;What is
        he doing up there?&rdquo; And they called Château-Renaud&rsquo;s attention to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How pale he is!&rdquo; said Château-Renaud, shuddering.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;He is cold,&rdquo; said Debray.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not at all,&rdquo; said Château-Renaud, slowly; &ldquo;I think he
        is violently agitated. He is very susceptible.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Bah,&rdquo; said Debray; &ldquo;he scarcely knew Mademoiselle de
        Villefort; you said so yourself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;True. Still I remember he danced three times with her at Madame de
        Morcerf&rsquo;s. Do you recollect that ball, count, where you produced
        such an effect?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50121m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, I do not,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo, without even knowing of
        what or to whom he was speaking, so much was he occupied in watching
        Morrel, who was holding his breath with emotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The discourse is over; farewell, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the count,
        unceremoniously.
      </p>
      <p>
        And he disappeared without anyone seeing whither he went.
      </p>
      <p>
        The funeral being over, the guests returned to Paris. Château-Renaud looked for
        a moment for Morrel; but while they were watching the departure of the count,
        Morrel had quitted his post, and Château-Renaud, failing in his search, joined
        Debray and Beauchamp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo concealed himself behind a large tomb and awaited the arrival
        of Morrel, who by degrees approached the tomb now abandoned by spectators
        and workmen. Morrel threw a glance around, but before it reached the spot
        occupied by Monte Cristo the latter had advanced yet nearer, still
        unperceived. The young man knelt down. The count, with outstretched neck
        and glaring eyes, stood in an attitude ready to pounce upon Morrel upon
        the first occasion. Morrel bent his head till it touched the stone, then
        clutching the grating with both hands, he murmured:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, Valentine!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The count&rsquo;s heart was pierced by the utterance of these two words; he
        stepped forward, and touching the young man&rsquo;s shoulder, said:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I was looking for you, my friend.&rdquo; Monte Cristo expected a burst
        of passion, but he was deceived, for Morrel turning round, said calmly,&mdash;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You see I was praying.&rdquo; The scrutinizing glance of the count
        searched the young man from head to foot. He then seemed more easy.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Shall I drive you back to Paris?&rdquo; he asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, thank you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you wish anything?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Leave me to pray.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The count withdrew without opposition, but it was only to place himself in a
        situation where he could watch every movement of Morrel, who at length arose,
        brushed the dust from his knees, and turned towards Paris, without once looking
        back. He walked slowly down the Rue de la Roquette. The count, dismissing his
        carriage, followed him about a hundred paces behind. Maximilian crossed the canal
        and entered the Rue Meslay by the boulevards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Five minutes after the door had been closed on Morrel&rsquo;s entrance, it was
        again opened for the count. Julie was at the entrance of the garden, where she
        was attentively watching Penelon, who, entering with zeal into his profession of
        gardener, was very busy grafting some Bengal roses. &ldquo;Ah, count,&rdquo; she
        exclaimed, with the delight manifested by every member of the family whenever
        he visited the Rue Meslay.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Maximilian has just returned, has he not, madame?&rdquo; asked the
        count.
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50123m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I think I saw him pass; but pray, call Emmanuel.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Excuse me, madame, but I must go up to Maximilian&rsquo;s room this
        instant,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo, &ldquo;I have something of the
        greatest importance to tell him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Go, then,&rdquo; she said with a charming smile, which accompanied
        him until he had disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo soon ran up the staircase conducting from the ground floor to
        Maximilian&rsquo;s room; when he reached the landing he listened attentively, but
        all was still. Like many old houses occupied by a single family, the room door was
        panelled with glass; but it was locked, Maximilian was shut in, and it was
        impossible to see what was passing in the room, because a red curtain was drawn
        before the glass. The count&rsquo;s anxiety was manifested by a bright color
        which seldom appeared on the face of that imperturbable man.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What shall I do!&rdquo; he uttered, and reflected for a moment;
        &ldquo;shall I ring? No, the sound of a bell, announcing a visitor, will
        but accelerate the resolution of one in Maximilian&rsquo;s situation, and
        then the bell would be followed by a louder noise.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo trembled from head to foot and as if his determination had been
        taken with the rapidity of lightning, he struck one of the panes of glass with
        his elbow; the glass was shivered to atoms, then withdrawing the curtain he
        saw Morrel, who had been writing at his desk, bound from his seat at the
        noise of the broken window.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I beg a thousand pardons,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;there is
        nothing the matter, but I slipped down and broke one of your panes of
        glass with my elbow. Since it is opened, I will take advantage of it to
        enter your room; do not disturb yourself&mdash;do not disturb yourself!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        And passing his hand through the broken glass, the count opened the door.
        Morrel, evidently discomposed, came to meet Monte Cristo less with the
        intention of receiving him than to exclude his entry.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Ma foi</i>,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, rubbing his elbow,
        &ldquo;it&rsquo;s all your servant&rsquo;s fault; your stairs are so polished,
        it is like walking on glass.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Are you hurt, sir?&rdquo; coldly asked Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I believe not. But what are you about there? You were writing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your fingers are stained with ink.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, true, I was writing. I do sometimes, soldier though I am.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo advanced into the room; Maximilian was obliged to let him
        pass, but he followed him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You were writing?&rdquo; said Monte Cristo with a searching look.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have already had the honor of telling you I was,&rdquo; said
        Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The count looked around him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Your pistols are beside your desk,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, pointing
        with his finger to the pistols on the table.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am on the point of starting on a journey,&rdquo; replied Morrel
        disdainfully.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; exclaimed Monte Cristo in a tone of exquisite
        sweetness.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sir?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My friend, my dear Maximilian, do not make a hasty resolution, I
        entreat you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I make a hasty resolution?&rdquo; said Morrel, shrugging his
        shoulders; &ldquo;is there anything extraordinary in a journey?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50125m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Maximilian,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;let us both lay aside the
        mask we have assumed. You no more deceive me with that false calmness than
        I impose upon you with my frivolous solicitude. You can understand, can
        you not, that to have acted as I have done, to have broken that glass, to
        have intruded on the solitude of a friend&mdash;you can understand that,
        to have done all this, I must have been actuated by real uneasiness, or
        rather by a terrible conviction. Morrel, you are going to destroy
        yourself!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed, count,&rdquo; said Morrel, shuddering; &ldquo;what has put
        this into your head?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I tell you that you are about to destroy yourself,&rdquo; continued
        the count, &ldquo;and here is proof of what I say;&rdquo; and, approaching
        the desk, he removed the sheet of paper which Morrel had placed over the
        letter he had begun, and took the latter in his hands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel rushed forward to tear it from him, but Monte Cristo perceiving his
        intention, seized his wrist with his iron grasp.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You wish to destroy yourself,&rdquo; said the count; &ldquo;you have
        written it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Morrel, changing his expression of calmness for
        one of violence&mdash;&ldquo;well, and if I do intend to turn this pistol
        against myself, who shall prevent me&mdash;who will dare prevent me? All
        my hopes are blighted, my heart is broken, my life a burden, everything
        around me is sad and mournful; earth has become distasteful to me, and
        human voices distract me. It is a mercy to let me die, for if I live I
        shall lose my reason and become mad. When, sir, I tell you all this with
        tears of heartfelt anguish, can you reply that I am wrong, can you prevent
        my putting an end to my miserable existence? Tell me, sir, could you have
        the courage to do so?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, Morrel,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, with a calmness which
        contrasted strangely with the young man&rsquo;s excitement; &ldquo;yes, I
        would do so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You?&rdquo; exclaimed Morrel, with increasing anger and reproach&mdash;&ldquo;you,
        who have deceived me with false hopes, who have cheered and soothed me
        with vain promises, when I might, if not have saved her, at least have
        seen her die in my arms! You, who pretend to understand everything, even
        the hidden sources of knowledge,&mdash;and who enact the part of a
        guardian angel upon earth, and could not even find an antidote to a poison
        administered to a young girl! Ah, sir, indeed you would inspire me with
        pity, were you not hateful in my eyes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Morrel&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; you tell me to lay aside the mask, and I will do so, be
        satisfied! When you spoke to me at the cemetery, I answered you&mdash;my
        heart was softened; when you arrived here, I allowed you to enter. But
        since you abuse my confidence, since you have devised a new torture after
        I thought I had exhausted them all, then, Count of Monte Cristo my
        pretended benefactor&mdash;then, Count of Monte Cristo, the universal
        guardian, be satisfied, you shall witness the death of your friend;&rdquo;
        and Morrel, with a maniacal laugh, again rushed towards the pistols.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And I again repeat, you shall not commit suicide.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Prevent me, then!&rdquo; replied Morrel, with another struggle,
        which, like the first, failed in releasing him from the count&rsquo;s iron
        grasp.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will prevent you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/50127m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And who are you, then, that arrogate to yourself this tyrannical
        right over free and rational beings?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Who am I?&rdquo; repeated Monte Cristo. &ldquo;Listen; I am the
        only man in the world having the right to say to you, &lsquo;Morrel, your
        father&rsquo;s son shall not die today;&rsquo;&rdquo; and Monte Cristo,
        with an expression of majesty and sublimity, advanced with arms folded
        toward the young man, who, involuntarily overcome by the commanding manner
        of this man, recoiled a step.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why do you mention my father?&rdquo; stammered he; &ldquo;why do
        you mingle a recollection of him with the affairs of today?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because I am he who saved your father&rsquo;s life when he wished
        to destroy himself, as you do today&mdash;because I am the man who sent
        the purse to your young sister, and the <i>Pharaon</i> to old Morrel&mdash;because
        I am the Edmond Dantès who nursed you, a child, on my knees.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel made another step back, staggering, breathless, crushed; then all his
        strength give way, and he fell prostrate at the feet of Monte Cristo. Then
        his admirable nature underwent a complete and sudden revulsion; he arose,
        rushed out of the room and to the stairs, exclaiming energetically,
        &ldquo;Julie, Julie&mdash;Emmanuel, Emmanuel!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo endeavored also to leave, but Maximilian would have died
        rather than relax his hold of the handle of the door, which he closed upon
        the count. Julie, Emmanuel, and some of the servants, ran up in alarm on
        hearing the cries of Maximilian. Morrel seized their hands, and opening
        the door exclaimed in a voice choked with sobs:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On your knees&mdash;on your knees&mdash;he is our benefactor&mdash;the
        saviour of our father! He is&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        He would have added &ldquo;Edmond Dantès,&rdquo; but the count seized his
        arm and prevented him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Julie threw herself into the arms of the count; Emmanuel embraced him as a guardian
        angel; Morrel again fell on his knees, and struck the ground with his forehead.
        Then the iron-hearted man felt his heart swell in his breast; a flame seemed to
        rush from his throat to his eyes, he bent his head and wept. For a while nothing
        was heard in the room but a succession of sobs, while the incense from their
        grateful hearts mounted to heaven. Julie had scarcely recovered from her deep
        emotion when she rushed out of the room, descended to the next floor, ran
        into the drawing-room with childlike joy and raised the crystal globe
        which covered the purse given by the unknown of the Allées de Meilhan.
        Meanwhile, Emmanuel in a broken voice said to the count:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, count, how could you, hearing us so often speak of our unknown
        benefactor, seeing us pay such homage of gratitude and adoration to his
        memory,&mdash;how could you continue so long without discovering yourself to us?
        Oh, it was cruel to us, and&mdash;dare I say it?&mdash;to you also.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen, my friends,&rdquo; said the count&mdash;&ldquo;I may call
        you so since we have really been friends for the last eleven years&mdash;the
        discovery of this secret has been occasioned by a great event which you
        must never know. I wished to bury it during my whole life in my own bosom,
        but your brother Maximilian wrested it from me by a violence he repents of
        now, I am sure.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Then turning around, and seeing that Morrel, still on his knees, had thrown
        himself into an armchair, he added in a low voice, pressing Emmanuel&rsquo;s
        hand significantly, &ldquo;Watch over him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo; asked the young man, surprised.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I cannot explain myself; but watch over him.&rdquo; Emmanuel looked
        around the room and caught sight of the pistols; his eyes rested on the
        weapons, and he pointed to them. Monte Cristo bent his head. Emmanuel went
        towards the pistols.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Leave them,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo. Then walking towards Morrel, he
        took his hand; the tumultuous agitation of the young man was succeeded by a
        profound stupor. Julie returned, holding the silken purse in her hands, while
        tears of joy rolled down her cheeks, like dewdrops on the rose.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Here is the relic,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;do not think it will be
        less dear to us now we are acquainted with our benefactor!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My child,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, coloring, &ldquo;allow me to
        take back that purse? Since you now know my face, I wish to be remembered
        alone through the affection I hope you will grant me.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Julie, pressing the purse to her heart, &ldquo;no,
        no, I beseech you do not take it, for some unhappy day you will leave us,
        will you not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You have guessed rightly, madame,&rdquo; replied Monte Cristo,
        smiling; &ldquo;in a week I shall have left this country, where so many
        persons who merit the vengeance of Heaven lived happily, while my father
        perished of hunger and grief.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        While announcing his departure, the count fixed his eyes on Morrel, and remarked
        that the words, &ldquo;I shall have left this country,&rdquo; had failed to rouse
        him from his lethargy. He then saw that he must make another struggle against the
        grief of his friend, and taking the hands of Emmanuel and Julie, which he
        pressed within his own, he said with the mild authority of a father:
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My kind friends, leave me alone with Maximilian.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Julie saw the means offered of carrying off her precious relic, which Monte Cristo
        had forgotten. She drew her husband to the door. &ldquo;Let us leave them,&rdquo;
        she said.
      </p>
      <p>
        The count was alone with Morrel, who remained motionless as a statue.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Monte-Cristo, touching his shoulder with his
        finger, &ldquo;are you a man again, Maximilian?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; for I begin to suffer again.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The count frowned, apparently in gloomy hesitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Maximilian, Maximilian,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the ideas you yield
        to are unworthy of a Christian.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, do not fear, my friend,&rdquo; said Morrel, raising his head,
        and smiling with a sweet expression on the count; &ldquo;I shall no longer
        attempt my life.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then we are to have no more pistols&mdash;no more despair?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; I have found a better remedy for my grief than either a bullet
        or a knife.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Poor fellow, what is it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My grief will kill me of itself.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My friend,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, with an expression of
        melancholy equal to his own, &ldquo;listen to me. One day, in a moment of
        despair like yours, since it led to a similar resolution, I also wished to
        kill myself; one day your father, equally desperate, wished to kill
        himself too. If anyone had said to your father, at the moment he raised
        the pistol to his head&mdash;if anyone had told me, when in my prison I
        pushed back the food I had not tasted for three days&mdash;if anyone had
        said to either of us then, &lsquo;Live&mdash;the day will come when you
        will be happy, and will bless life!&rsquo;&mdash;no matter whose voice had
        spoken, we should have heard him with the smile of doubt, or the anguish
        of incredulity,&mdash;and yet how many times has your father blessed life
        while embracing you&mdash;how often have I myself&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; exclaimed Morrel, interrupting the count, &ldquo;you had
        only lost your liberty, my father had only lost his fortune, but I have
        lost Valentine.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Look at me,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, with that expression which
        sometimes made him so eloquent and persuasive&mdash;&ldquo;look at me.
        There are no tears in my eyes, nor is there fever in my veins, yet I see
        you suffer&mdash;you, Maximilian, whom I love as my own son. Well, does
        not this tell you that in grief, as in life, there is always something to
        look forward to beyond? Now, if I entreat, if I order you to live, Morrel,
        it is in the conviction that one day you will thank me for having
        preserved your life.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, heavens,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;oh, heavens&mdash;what
        are you saying, count? Take care. But perhaps you have never loved!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Child!&rdquo; replied the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I mean, as I love. You see, I have been a soldier ever since I
        attained manhood. I reached the age of twenty-nine without loving, for
        none of the feelings I before then experienced merit the appellation of
        love. Well, at twenty-nine I saw Valentine; for two years I have loved
        her, for two years I have seen written in her heart, as in a book, all the
        virtues of a daughter and wife. Count, to possess Valentine would have
        been a happiness too infinite, too ecstatic, too complete, too divine for
        this world, since it has been denied me; but without Valentine the earth
        is desolate.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have told you to hope,&rdquo; said the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then have a care, I repeat, for you seek to persuade me, and if you
        succeed I should lose my reason, for I should hope that I could again
        behold Valentine.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        The count smiled.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My friend, my father,&rdquo; said Morrel with excitement, &ldquo;have a
        care, I again repeat, for the power you wield over me alarms me. Weigh your words
        before you speak, for my eyes have already become brighter, and my heart beats
        strongly; be cautious, or you will make me believe in supernatural agencies. I must
        obey you, though you bade me call forth the dead or walk upon the water.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Hope, my friend,&rdquo; repeated the count.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Morrel, falling from the height of excitement to
        the abyss of despair&mdash;&ldquo;ah, you are playing with me, like those
        good, or rather selfish mothers who soothe their children with honeyed
        words, because their screams annoy them. No, my friend, I was wrong to
        caution you; do not fear, I will bury my grief so deep in my heart, I will
        disguise it so, that you shall not even care to sympathize with me. Adieu,
        my friend, adieu!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;after this time you
        must live with me&mdash;you must not leave me, and in a week we shall have
        left France behind us.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you still bid me hope?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I tell you to hope, because I have a method of curing you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Count, you render me sadder than before, if it be possible. You
        think the result of this blow has been to produce an ordinary grief, and
        you would cure it by an ordinary remedy&mdash;change of scene.&rdquo; And
        Morrel dropped his head with disdainful incredulity.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What can I say more?&rdquo; asked Monte Cristo. &ldquo;I have
        confidence in the remedy I propose, and only ask you to permit me to
        assure you of its efficacy.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Count, you prolong my agony.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the count, &ldquo;your feeble spirit will not
        even grant me the trial I request? Come&mdash;do you know of what the
        Count of Monte Cristo is capable? do you know that he holds terrestrial
        beings under his control? nay, that he can almost work a miracle? Well,
        wait for the miracle I hope to accomplish, or&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Or?&rdquo; repeated Morrel.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Or, take care, Morrel, lest I call you ungrateful.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Have pity on me, count!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I feel so much pity towards you, Maximilian, that&mdash;listen to
        me attentively&mdash;if I do not cure you in a month, to the day, to the
        very hour, mark my words, Morrel, I will place loaded pistols before you,
        and a cup of the deadliest Italian poison&mdash;a poison more sure and
        prompt than that which has killed Valentine.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Will you promise me?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; for I am a man, and have suffered like yourself, and also
        contemplated suicide; indeed, often since misfortune has left me I have
        longed for the delights of an eternal sleep.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But you are sure you will promise me this?&rdquo; said Morrel,
        intoxicated.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I not only promise, but swear it!&rdquo; said Monte Cristo extending
        his hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In a month, then, on your honor, if I am not consoled, you will let
        me take my life into my own hands, and whatever may happen you will not
        call me ungrateful?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In a month, to the day, the very hour and the date is a sacred one,
        Maximilian. I do not know whether you remember that this is the 5th of
        September; it is ten years today since I saved your father&rsquo;s life,
        who wished to die.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Morrel seized the count&rsquo;s hand and kissed it; the count allowed him to pay
        the homage he felt due to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In a month you will find on the table, at which we shall be then sitting,
        good pistols and a delicious draught; but, on the other hand, you must promise
        me not to attempt your life before that time.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I also swear it!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo drew the young man towards him, and pressed him for some time
        to his heart. &ldquo;And now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;after today, you will
        come and live with me; you can occupy Haydée&rsquo;s apartment, and my
        daughter will at least be replaced by my son.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Haydée?&rdquo; said Morrel, &ldquo;what has become of her?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;She departed last night.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To leave you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;To wait for me. Hold yourself ready then to join me at the
        Champs-Élysées, and lead me out of this house without anyone seeing my
        departure.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Maximilian hung his head, and obeyed with childlike reverence.
