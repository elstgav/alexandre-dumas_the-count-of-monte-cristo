      <p class="pfirst">
        <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he day following
        this scene, at the hour Debray usually chose to pay a visit to Madame
        Danglars on his way to his office, his <i>coupé</i> did not appear. At
        this time, that is, about half-past twelve, Madame Danglars ordered her
        carriage, and went out. Danglars, hidden behind a curtain, watched the
        departure he had been waiting for. He gave orders that he should be
        informed as soon as Madame Danglars appeared; but at two o&rsquo;clock she
        had not returned. He then called for his horses, drove to the Chamber, and
        inscribed his name to speak against the budget. From twelve to two o&rsquo;clock
        Danglars had remained in his study, unsealing his dispatches, and becoming
        more and more sad every minute, heaping figure upon figure, and receiving,
        among other visits, one from Major Cavalcanti, who, as stiff and exact as
        ever, presented himself precisely at the hour named the night before, to
        terminate his business with the banker.
      </p>
      <p>
        On leaving the Chamber, Danglars, who had shown violent marks of agitation during
        the sitting, and been more bitter than ever against the ministry, re-entered his
        carriage, and told the coachman to drive to the Avenue des Champs-Élysées, No. 30.
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo was at home; only he was engaged with someone and begged
        Danglars to wait for a moment in the drawing-room. While the banker was
        waiting in the anteroom, the door opened, and a man dressed as an abbé and
        doubtless more familiar with the house than he was, came in and instead of
        waiting, merely bowed, passed on to the farther apartments, and disappeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        A minute after the door by which the priest had entered reopened, and Monte
        Cristo appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;my dear baron, but one of my friends, the
        Abbé Busoni, whom you perhaps saw pass by, has just arrived in Paris; not having
        seen him for a long time, I could not make up my mind to leave him sooner, so I
        hope this will be sufficient reason for my having made you wait.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; said Danglars, &ldquo;it is my fault; I have chosen my
        visit at a wrong time, and will retire.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not at all; on the contrary, be seated; but what is the matter with
        you? You look careworn; really, you alarm me. Melancholy in a capitalist,
        like the appearance of a comet, presages some misfortune to the world.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have been in ill-luck for several days,&rdquo; said Danglars,
        &ldquo;and I have heard nothing but bad news.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, indeed?&rdquo; said Monte Cristo. &ldquo;Have you had another
        fall at the Bourse?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; I am safe for a few days at least. I am only annoyed about a
        bankrupt of Trieste.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Really? Does it happen to be Jacopo Manfredi?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Exactly so. Imagine a man who has transacted business with me for I
        don&rsquo;t know how long, to the amount of 800,000 or 900,000 francs
        during the year. Never a mistake or delay&mdash;a fellow who paid like a
        prince. Well, I was a million in advance with him, and now my fine Jacopo
        Manfredi suspends payment!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is an unheard-of fatality. I draw upon him for 600,000 francs,
        my bills are returned unpaid, and, more than that, I hold bills of
        exchange signed by him to the value of 400,000 francs, payable at his
        correspondent&rsquo;s in Paris at the end of this month. Today is the
        30th. I present them; but my correspondent has disappeared. This, with my
        Spanish affairs, made a pretty end to the month.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you really lost by that affair in Spain?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; only 700,000 francs out of my cash box&mdash;nothing more!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why, how could you make such a mistake&mdash;such an old stager?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, it is all my wife&rsquo;s fault. She dreamed Don Carlos had
        returned to Spain; she believes in dreams. It is magnetism, she says, and
        when she dreams a thing it is sure to happen, she assures me. On this
        conviction I allow her to speculate, she having her bank and her
        stockbroker; she speculated and lost. It is true she speculates with her
        own money, not mine; nevertheless, you can understand that when 700,000
        francs leave the wife&rsquo;s pocket, the husband always finds it out. But
        do you mean to say you have not heard of this? Why, the thing has made a
        tremendous noise.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, I heard it spoken of, but I did not know the details, and then
        no one can be more ignorant than I am of the affairs in the Bourse.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30251m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you do not speculate?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I?&mdash;How could I speculate when I already have so much trouble
        in regulating my income? I should be obliged, besides my steward, to keep
        a clerk and a boy. But touching these Spanish affairs, I think that the
        baroness did not dream the whole of the Don Carlos matter. The papers said
        something about it, did they not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then you believe the papers?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I?&mdash;not the least in the world; only I fancied that the honest
        <i>Messager</i> was an exception to the rule, and that it only announced
        telegraphic despatches.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what puzzles me,&rdquo; replied Danglars;
        &ldquo;the news of the return of Don Carlos was brought by telegraph.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So that,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo, &ldquo;you have lost nearly
        1,700,000 francs this month.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not nearly, indeed; that is exactly my loss.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Diable!</i>&rdquo; said Monte Cristo compassionately, &ldquo;it
        is a hard blow for a third-rate fortune.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Third-rate,&rdquo; said Danglars, rather humble, &ldquo;what do you
        mean by that?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; continued Monte Cristo, &ldquo;I make three
        assortments in fortune&mdash;first-rate, second-rate, and third-rate
        fortunes. I call those first-rate which are composed of treasures one
        possesses under one&rsquo;s hand, such as mines, lands, and funded
        property, in such states as France, Austria, and England, provided these
        treasures and property form a total of about a hundred millions; I call
        those second-rate fortunes, that are gained by manufacturing enterprises,
        joint-stock companies, viceroyalties, and principalities, not drawing more
        than 1,500,000 francs, the whole forming a capital of about fifty
        millions; finally, I call those third-rate fortunes, which are composed of
        a fluctuating capital, dependent upon the will of others, or upon chances
        which a bankruptcy involves or a false telegram shakes, such as banks,
        speculations of the day&mdash;in fact, all operations under the influence
        of greater or less mischances, the whole bringing in a real or fictitious
        capital of about fifteen millions. I think this is about your position, is
        it not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Confound it, yes!&rdquo; replied Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The result, then, of six more such months as this would be to
        reduce the third-rate house to despair.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Danglars, becoming very pale, how you are running
        on!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Let us imagine seven such months,&rdquo; continued Monte Cristo, in
        the same tone. &ldquo;Tell me, have you ever thought that seven times
        1,700,000 francs make nearly twelve millions? No, you have not;&mdash;well,
        you are right, for if you indulged in such reflections, you would never
        risk your principal, which is to the speculator what the skin is to
        civilized man. We have our clothes, some more splendid than others,&mdash;this
        is our credit; but when a man dies he has only his skin; in the same way,
        on retiring from business, you have nothing but your real principal of
        about five or six millions, at the most; for third-rate fortunes are never
        more than a fourth of what they appear to be, like the locomotive on a
        railway, the size of which is magnified by the smoke and steam surrounding
        it. Well, out of the five or six millions which form your real capital,
        you have just lost nearly two millions, which must, of course, in the same
        degree diminish your credit and fictitious fortune; to follow out my
        simile, your skin has been opened by bleeding, and this if repeated three
        or four times will cause death&mdash;so pay attention to it, my dear
        Monsieur Danglars. Do you want money? Do you wish me to lend you some?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30253m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What a bad calculator you are!&rdquo; exclaimed Danglars, calling
        to his assistance all his philosophy and dissimulation. &ldquo;I have made
        money at the same time by speculations which have succeeded. I have made
        up the loss of blood by nutrition. I lost a battle in Spain, I have been
        defeated in Trieste, but my naval army in India will have taken some
        galleons, and my Mexican pioneers will have discovered some mine.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very good, very good! But the wound remains and will reopen at the
        first loss.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No, for I am only embarked in certainties,&rdquo; replied Danglars,
        with the air of a mountebank sounding his own praises; &ldquo;to involve
        me, three governments must crumble to dust.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, such things have been.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;That there should be a famine!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Recollect the seven fat and the seven lean kine.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Or, that the sea should become dry, as in the days of Pharaoh, and
        even then my vessels would become caravans.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So much the better. I congratulate you, my dear M. Danglars,&rdquo;
        said Monte Cristo; &ldquo;I see I was deceived, and that you belong to the
        class of second-rate fortunes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I think I may aspire to that honor,&rdquo; said Danglars with a
        smile, which reminded Monte Cristo of the sickly moons which bad artists
        are so fond of daubing into their pictures of ruins. &ldquo;But, while we
        are speaking of business,&rdquo; Danglars added, pleased to find an
        opportunity of changing the subject, &ldquo;tell me what I am to do for M.
        Cavalcanti.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Give him money, if he is recommended to you, and the recommendation
        seems good.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Excellent; he presented himself this morning with a bond of 40,000
        francs, payable at sight, on you, signed by Busoni, and returned by you to
        me, with your endorsement&mdash;of course, I immediately counted him over
        the forty bank-notes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo nodded his head in token of assent.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But that is not all,&rdquo; continued Danglars; &ldquo;he has opened an
        account with my house for his son.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;May I ask how much he allows the young man?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Five thousand francs per month.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Sixty thousand francs per year. I thought I was right in believing
        that Cavalcanti to be a stingy fellow. How can a young man live upon 5,000
        francs a month?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But you understand that if the young man should want a few
        thousands more&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do not advance it; the father will never repay it. You do not know
        these ultramontane millionaires; they are regular misers. And by whom were
        they recommended to you?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, by the house of Fenzi, one of the best in Florence.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I do not mean to say you will lose, but, nevertheless, mind you
        hold to the terms of the agreement.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Would you not trust the Cavalcanti?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I? oh, I would advance ten millions on his signature. I was only
        speaking in reference to the second-rate fortunes we were mentioning just
        now.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And with all this, how unassuming he is! I should never have taken
        him for anything more than a mere major.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you would have flattered him, for certainly, as you say, he has
        no manner. The first time I saw him he appeared to me like an old
        lieutenant who had grown mouldy under his epaulets. But all the Italians
        are the same; they are like old Jews when they are not glittering in
        Oriental splendor.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The young man is better,&rdquo; said Danglars.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; a little nervous, perhaps, but, upon the whole, he appeared
        tolerable. I was uneasy about him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because you met him at my house, just after his introduction into
        the world, as they told me. He has been travelling with a very severe
        tutor, and had never been to Paris before.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, I believe noblemen marry amongst themselves, do they not?&rdquo;
        asked Danglars carelessly; &ldquo;they like to unite their fortunes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It is usual, certainly; but Cavalcanti is an original who does
        nothing like other people. I cannot help thinking that he has brought his
        son to France to choose a wife.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I am sure of it.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you have heard his fortune mentioned?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Nothing else was talked of; only some said he was worth millions,
        and others that he did not possess a farthing.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And what is your opinion?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I ought not to influence you, because it is only my own personal
        impression.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, and it is that&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;My opinion is, that all these old <i>podestàs</i>, these ancient <i>condottieri</i>,&mdash;for
        the Cavalcanti have commanded armies and governed provinces,&mdash;my
        opinion, I say, is, that they have buried their millions in corners, the
        secret of which they have transmitted only to their eldest sons, who have
        done the same from generation to generation; and the proof of this is seen
        in their yellow and dry appearance, like the florins of the republic,
        which, from being constantly gazed upon, have become reflected in them.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said Danglars, &ldquo;and this is further
        supported by the fact of their not possessing an inch of land.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Very little, at least; I know of none which Cavalcanti possesses,
        excepting his palace in Lucca.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, he has a palace?&rdquo; said Danglars, laughing; &ldquo;come,
        that is something.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes; and more than that, he lets it to the Minister of Finance
        while he lives in a simple house. Oh, as I told you before, I think the
        old fellow is very close.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Come, you do not flatter him.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I scarcely know him; I think I have seen him three times in my
        life; all I know relating to him is through Busoni and himself. He was
        telling me this morning that, tired of letting his property lie dormant in
        Italy, which is a dead nation, he wished to find a method, either in
        France or England, of multiplying his millions, but remember, that though
        I place great confidence in Busoni, I am not responsible for this.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Never mind; accept my thanks for the client you have sent me. It is
        a fine name to inscribe on my ledgers, and my cashier was quite proud of
        it when I explained to him who the Cavalcanti were. By the way, this is
        merely a simple question, when this sort of people marry their sons, do
        they give them any fortune?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, that depends upon circumstances. I know an Italian prince, rich
        as a gold mine, one of the noblest families in Tuscany, who, when his sons
        married according to his wish, gave them millions; and when they married
        against his consent, merely allowed them thirty crowns a month. Should
        Andrea marry according to his father&rsquo;s views, he will, perhaps, give
        him one, two, or three millions. For example, supposing it were the
        daughter of a banker, he might take an interest in the house of the
        father-in-law of his son; then again, if he disliked his choice, the major
        takes the key, double-locks his coffer, and Master Andrea would be obliged
        to live like the sons of a Parisian family, by shuffling cards or rattling
        the dice.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, that boy will find out some Bavarian or Peruvian princess; he
        will want a crown, an El Dorado, and Potosí.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;No; these grand lords on the other side of the Alps frequently
        marry into plain families; like Jupiter, they like to cross the race. But
        do you wish to marry Andrea, my dear M. Danglars, that you are asking so
        many questions?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Ma foi</i>,&rdquo; said Danglars, &ldquo;it would not be a bad
        speculation, I fancy, and you know I am a speculator.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are not thinking of Mademoiselle Danglars, I hope; you would
        not like poor Andrea to have his throat cut by Albert?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Albert,&rdquo; repeated Danglars, shrugging his shoulders; &ldquo;ah,
        well; he would care very little about it, I think.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But he is betrothed to your daughter, I believe?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, M. de Morcerf and I have talked about this marriage, but
        Madame de Morcerf and Albert&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You do not mean to say that it would not be a good match?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Indeed, I imagine that Mademoiselle Danglars is as good as M. de
        Morcerf.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Mademoiselle Danglars&rsquo; fortune will be great, no doubt,
        especially if the telegraph should not make any more mistakes.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, I do not mean her fortune only; but tell me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why did you not invite M. and Madame de Morcerf to your dinner?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I did so, but he excused himself on account of Madame de Morcerf
        being obliged to go to Dieppe for the benefit of sea air.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Danglars, laughing, &ldquo;it would do her a
        great deal of good.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because it is the air she always breathed in her youth.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Monte Cristo took no notice of this ill-natured remark.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;But still, if Albert be not so rich as Mademoiselle Danglars,&rdquo;
        said the count, &ldquo;you must allow that he has a fine name?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;So he has; but I like mine as well.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Certainly; your name is popular, and does honor to the title they
        have adorned it with; but you are too intelligent not to know that
        according to a prejudice, too firmly rooted to be exterminated, a nobility
        which dates back five centuries is worth more than one that can only
        reckon twenty years.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And for this very reason,&rdquo; said Danglars with a smile, which
        he tried to make sardonic, &ldquo;I prefer M. Andrea Cavalcanti to M.
        Albert de Morcerf.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Still, I should not think the Morcerfs would yield to the
        Cavalcanti?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;The Morcerfs!&mdash;Stay, my dear count,&rdquo; said Danglars;
        &ldquo;you are a man of the world, are you not?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And you understand heraldry?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A little.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, look at my coat-of-arms, it is worth more than Morcerf&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Why so?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because, though I am not a baron by birth, my real name is, at
        least, Danglars.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, what then?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;While his name is not Morcerf.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How?&mdash;not Morcerf?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Not the least in the world.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I have been made a baron, so that I actually am one; he made
        himself a count, so that he is not one at all.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Impossible!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Listen my dear count; M. de Morcerf has been my friend, or rather
        my acquaintance, during the last thirty years. You know I have made the
        most of my arms, though I never forgot my origin.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;A proof of great humility or great pride,&rdquo; said Monte Cristo.
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, when I was a clerk, Morcerf was a mere fisherman.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And then he was called&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Fernand.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Only Fernand?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Fernand Mondego.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are sure?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;<i>Pardieu!</i> I have bought enough fish of him to know his name.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Then, why did you think of giving your daughter to him?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Because Fernand and Danglars, being both parvenus, both having
        become noble, both rich, are about equal in worth, excepting that there
        have been certain things mentioned of him that were never said of me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Oh, nothing!&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Ah, yes; what you tell me recalls to mind something about the name
        of Fernand Mondego. I have heard that name in Greece.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;In conjunction with the affairs of Ali Pasha?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Exactly so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;This is the mystery,&rdquo; said Danglars. &ldquo;I acknowledge I
        would have given anything to find it out.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;It would be very easy if you much wished it?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;How so?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Probably you have some correspondent in Greece?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I should think so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;At Yanina?&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Everywhere.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Well, write to your correspondent in Yanina, and ask him what part
        was played by a Frenchman named Fernand Mondego in the catastrophe of Ali
        Tepelini.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; exclaimed Danglars, rising quickly, &ldquo;I
        will write today.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;Do so.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <img class="fig" src="images/30259m.jpg"/>
      <p>
        &ldquo;And if you should hear of anything very scandalous&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;I will communicate it to you.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        &ldquo;You will oblige me.&rdquo;
      </p>
      <p>
        Danglars rushed out of the room, and made but one leap into his <i>coupé</i>.
